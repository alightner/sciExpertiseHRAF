t0287 cite0001 FO07 "The Azande believe that whatever the mode of death the real cause is witchcraft ( mangu) or magic, and that the spirit remains near the tomb until the duty of taking vengeance has been performed. Benge is consulted, and indicates who among the relatives shall observe the mourning taboos. It is again consulted, theoretically, in order to discover whether the death was due to witchcraft (black magic) or was the result of the dead man’s own misdeeds. If the latter it signifies that he was himself the culprit, in that owing to some malpractice—adultery, theft, or black magic of his own performance—he has fallen the victim of someone else’s protective magic, lawfully used: has in fact been killed by his own misdeeds. But frequently it is found that the death is due to the black magic of some envious person, and then vengeance is a duty. The person selected as avenger is given likipwo; this consists of some bark cloth worn by the dead man, together with nail-parings, hair, and sometimes in the old days a joint of the little finger. The avenger calls in someone with knowledge of the magic of death, really an expert, who may have learnt the magic from his father or even bought it. This man takes the likipwo, burns it, and places the ashes in the mouth of a magic whistle, which he blows, uttering a spell against the murderer. The whistle and some bagbuduma medicine are then hidden in the bark of a tree. The avenger is also given a magic whistle to blow and utter spells over by the medicine man, to whom he pays a spear for his services."
t0288 cite0001 FO07 "The avenger, now subject to many taboos, awaits the effect of the magic. Someone is sure to die in the vicinity within the next few weeks and the relatives will consult benge to determine whether this death is the result of their magic. If the reply is in the negative the avenger must suffer his taboos until someone else dies and an affirmative answer is given. When the victim of the magic is dead the medicine-man is again summoned in order that he may provide an antidote to the magic, which may otherwise fall upon the avenger and kill him also. The relatives eat the antidote and make over to the expert valuable presents, including several spears, also providing him with food and drink. The latter goes to the bush, takes the magic from the tree, and casts it into water to destroy its power."
t0289 cite0002 FO07 "At times an affliction may be seen as resulting from a previous social situation of the afflicted person—for instance, a wrong done by him to another—and it is concluded that the aggrieved party is using magic against him and will have to be sought out and asked to desist. If a man who is working vengeance magic for the death of a kinsman falls ill, his relatives will conclude that he has broken one of the taboos necessitated by his position and that his magic has turned back upon him. 38"
t0289 cite0002 FO07 "38 Ibid, p. 507. The relatives of the sick man will pay the specialist who has made the magic on his behalf to destroy its potency."
t0289 cite0002 FO07 "Illness may also be attributed to seeing cats—in which case a witch-doctor specializing in anti-cat magic is called upon."
t0290 cite0003 FO07 "Many people say that the great majority of witch-doctors are liars whose sole concern is to acquire wealth. I found that it was quite a normal belief among Azande that many of the practitioners are charlatans who make up any reply which they think will please their questioner, and whose sole inspiration is love of gain. It is indeed probable that Zande faith in their witch-doctors has declined since European conquest of their country, on account of the large increase in membership of the corporation. In the old days only two or three men in a province used to function as witch-doctors, whereas to-day they number scores. I have noticed again and again in other departments of Zande magic that faith tends to lessen as ownership spreads. To-day a witch-doctor has little scruple about teaching as many pupils as he can obtain and charging them ridiculously small fees in comparison with old-time standards. Moreover, the same risk does not now attach to the profession as used to be the case, when an error of judgement might entail serious consequences. In the general cultural disequilibrium due to the social changes consequent on conquests and administration, belief in magic and witchcraft has ceased to function adequately, and witch-doctorhood tends to become more a pastime than a serious profession. Nevertheless, there are many evidences which show [Page 184] decisively that scepticism is not a new phenomenon. There is, moreover, no question of direct Caucasian influence here because such influence is very slight among those Azande with whom I was best acquainted. Also old men who are entirely free from such influence have expressed to me the same scepticism about witch-doctors. Thus my old friend Ongosi used to tell me that most of what the witch-doctors told their audiences was just bera, just ‘supposition’: they think out what is the most likely cause of any trouble and put it forward, in the guise of an inspired oracle, as a likely guess, but it is not sangba ngua, the words of medicine, i.e. it is not derived from the medicines which they have eaten."
t0291 cite0003 FO07 "I particularly do not wish to give the impression that there is any one who disbelieves in witch-doctorhood. Most of my acquaintances believed that there are a few entirely reliable practitioners, but that the majority are quacks. Hence in the case of any particular witch-doctor they are never quite certain whether reliance can be placed on his statements or not. They know that some witch-doctors lie and that others tell the truth, but they cannot at once tell from his behaviour into which category any witch-doctor falls. They reserve judgement, and temper faith with scepticism."
t0292 cite0003 FO07 "It is evident that only a people imbued with a measure of scepticism could treat diviners in this manner. Only a people who understand that much of the power claimed by diviners is nothing but shrewd guess-work, coupled with professional dogmatism, could thus mock them. Yet Mbira believed firmly in every kind of magic, was, in fact, himself a magician of standing, and believed, moreover, in the particular kind of magic which gives prophetic powers to witch-doctors. When he was in trouble he summoned practitioners to his homestead and listened with respect to their words. He was convinced that [Page 187] some witch-doctors were genuine and could tell you their names. These genuine practitioners might make mistakes, but they possessed excellent medicines which gave them real prophetic powers, and, above all, they possessed mangu (witchcraft-substance). He believed that only those practitioners who are themselves witches can observe and control witchcraft. Only through Beelzebub can you cast out devils. This point of view is shown clearly in the text which I have recorded above."
t0293 cite0003 FO07 "I was some twenty months in Zandeland and was constantly associated with every kind of sickness. At one time I spent about two hours every morning dressing sores, but eventually I gave up this practice when I found that it took too much of my time. Major Larken supplied our settlement with a dresser who took my place. When, therefore, I generalize about Zande notions of disease, I do so on a fairly wide experience. I have invariably found that when a Zande is struck down by general and acute sickness, with sudden and severe symptoms and rapid course, as in certain types of fever, pneumonia, cerebrospinal meningitis, influenza, &c., his relatives and neighbours straightway connect his collapse with the primary cause of witchcraft or sorcery, almost always in cases of sudden collapse with sorcery. They do not say that the sick man is suffering from such-and-such an illness and that this illness is due to sorcery. The illness itself is diagnosed as bad magic—they say, when they see the symptoms, ‘It is kitikiti ngua,’ ‘It is sorcery.’ They immediately apply to a man who knows the antidote to the particular sorcery and ask him to administer it to the sick person. In the same manner it sometimes happens that a man thinks he has seen evil-bringing adandara cats in the bush, and if he falls suddenly sick within the next two or three weeks he [Page 507] will know that his sickness is due to their influence and ultimately to the woman who placed them in his path. The sickness, in fact, proves that he really did see adandara and that he did not imagine that he had seen them or mistaken some other cats for them. His relatives send for a specialist who knows the antidote to adandara if they do not know it themselves. Here again they may not name the sickness at all but simply say, ‘It is adandara’ (see Part I, Chapter III)."
t0294 cite0004 MP05 "The dabtara, thanks to his knowledge of books and the lore acquired sub rosa while attending the church schools, wields many more powers than does the [unknown]tanquay . He can write amulets to keep away sickness and evil spirits. He knows formulas that can protect one from bullets and instill insatiable passion in the breast of one’s beloved. He has the power to bring rain or make it stop, and to plague the householder by turning all of his possessions against him. Like the [unknown]tanquay, his expert knowledge of plants and herbs can heal the sick or poison the client’s enemy. His superiority over the [unknown]tanquay is shown by the different manner in which he arranges a divination: he consults his heavy books, brews and interprets leaves, and then writes out his predictions on paper. For all this the dabtara’s fees are usually higher, but his status is perhaps more precarious, for he is after all a man of the church. The peasant feels none too easy in dealing with one who both serves the church and deals with devils."
t0295 cite0005 MP05 "The basic concepts and practices of Amhara medicine can be traced to ancient Egypt and the ancient Near East and can also be attributed to regional ecological links within Ethiopia. Often no sharp distinctions are made between bodily and spiritual ailments, but there are special occupations: the WOGGESHA (surgeon-herbalist) is a pragmatist; the DEBTERA (scribe) invokes the spirit world. The latter is officially or unofficially linked to the church, but the ZAR cult is apart and may even be female dominated. Its spirit healing has a complex cosmology; it involves the social status of the patient and includes group therapy. The chief ZAR doctor is often a matriarch who entered the profession when she herself was possessed by a spirit; she has managed to control some powerful spirits that she can then employ in her battles to overcome the spirits that possess her patients. No cure is expected, only control through negotiation and appeasement of the offended spirit, in the hope of turning it into a WEQABI (protective spirit). By contrast, possession by an evil spirit is considered more serious and less manageable than possession by a ZAR, and there is no cult. An effort is made to prevent it by wearing amulets and avoiding persons, who are skilled in trades like blacksmithing and pottery making. Since these spirits are believed to strike beautiful or successful persons, such individuals--especially if they are children--must not be praised out loud. If a person sickens and wastes away, an exorcism by the church may be attempted, or a TANQWAY (diviner- sorcerer) may be consulted; however, the latter recourse is considered risky and shameful."
t0296 cite0006 MP05 "Like the debtera, the wegesha is often an expert herbologist, called akk’abe s[unknown]ray (lit. who knows or keeps the work of nature). While walking in the bush, along brooks in the valley or in the dega upland, he notices and remembers the locations of plants and roots, which supply him with much of his pharmacopeia. His sense of direction is trained, and therefore seems uncanny to the layman. Moreover, not infrequently he actually transplants certain wild plants, so that he can always find them; these are located sufficiently far from residential habitations so that they are not easily found or consumed by cattle or disturbed by playful boys. A good rule for distance is how far the crowing of a rooster can be heard: some plants are believed to lose their magical power if disturbed by this sound."
t0297 cite0007 MP05 "The prophylactic measures [of an evil eye attack] include invoking God’s name every time a compliment is given, shaving of children’s heads, guardedness and social distance, cross-sex address, and the wearing of magical medicines and charms. The best curative after a strike has been made is to find the buda responsible and force him to confess and withdraw the curse (usually at gunpoint). A competent wizard may also be able to manufacture a counteractive medicine that will affect a curse."
t0298 cite0008 MP05 "The co-operation of spirits can be obtained (1) mechanically, through spells, prayers, rites (C.1, C.2), and sanctified healing waters ( tebel, C.1); or (2) personally and directly, when a debtera forces a demon into his presence and compels his assistance, or when a shaman allows a zar spirit to possess her."
t0298 cite0008 MP05 "The nature of the connection between spirits and numerological instructions, special objects, and astrological-numerological reckonings (B.2,3,4: a [Page 247] combination especially used in preparing medicaments) is not understood by lay folk."
t0298 cite0008 MP05 "E. Knowledge of magic is always privileged. The ability to tap the power of spirits may be general (prayer to the spirits of the church) or privileged. Knowledge of magic and privileged access to spirits is distributed among four categories of people: herbalists, ecclesiastics, shamans, and debtera . Most herbalists incorporate some magic (B.1,2,3, but never B.4) into their recipes. The rural herbalist is usually a farmer, indistinguishable from his fellows except for his curing. He is known to his public by his ability to treat a specific, named ailment, and his professional title indicates only his disease name specialty and his degree of proficiency, e.g., “expert curer for body ulcers.” Few herbalists offer therapies for more than three or four ailments. Magical directions are specific for each cure and are inherited with it. Any ecclesiastic can annoint sick people with sanctified healing waters. A shaman persuades zar familiars to provide information and influence other sickness-causing zars. Debtera who have special powers can be either “demon-pullers” ( ganel sabiy ), whose powers come from demon familiars and magic (B.1-4), or minor debtera ( tinish debtera ), whose powers come from magic only."
t0298 cite0008 MP05 "F. The kinds of people who hold these special powers are distinguished from one another according to the range and availability of their powers and the moral opprobrium attached to their practices and themselves. The annointer, the herbalist, and the zar shaman each aim for a single goal: to repel (A.2), retain (A.8), and divine (A.1), respectively. The shaman can also end sickness (A.3) for devotees of the zar cult. The debtera (particularly the demon-puller) works all ten goals (A.1-10) for any client. An important expression of the debtera ’s power is his ability to perform many different kinds of medical works—to predict, prevent, cure, and cause—for a great variety of ailments, particularly serious ones for which herbalist cures are rare and herbalist prophylaxes are absent altogether, and contingencies. According to ordinary Amhara, i.e., people who are neither ecclesiastics nor members of the zar cult, no opprobrium attaches to the works of the herbalist or the annointer, whose works are authorized by the church, and the works of the zar shaman are believed to be morally different rather than immoral. On the other hand, opprobrium does attach to the debtera because he is intimate with demons, some of his works are evil ( kifat ) and destructive (A.4), and he has committed serious sins ( badal ) against the church, aside from sorcery and intimacy with demons. ..."
t0298 cite0008 MP05 "Laymen are more certain of the moral facts that explain the debtera ’s path to power than they are about the technological ones. The moral facts are set out in the following archetypal biography by which laymen describe the professional lives of debtera magician-healers. As they see it, the debtera begins his career as an ordinary farmer-priest, who performs in the mass in his natal parish. He is no different from his fellow priests, except for a weakness in his character which makes him unable to keep within the proscriptions of the priestly life. Eventually, it leads him to commit a serious moral offense ( badal ), after which he can no longer perform the mass. Most often, it is adultery that spoils the priest’s identity. The theft of church tithes is another frequently mentioned act. Once discovered, he finds it impossible to continue his life in the parish. He is filled with shame; he is scorned by kinfolk and neighbors; and he loses his usufruct to church lands. But how is such a man to support himself once he has left the parish? Since his only resources now are his ability to read and write Amharic and Ge’ez (the language of the church) and his knowledge of the liturgy, he takes up a solitary wandering life as a debtera . His flawed nature gives him no peace, however, and he progresses from sin to sin until at last he seals his perdition by seeking the help of demons. At this point, he begins his career as a great magician, sorcerer, and healer. While no layman knows precisely how a debtera makes his contract with demons, it seems certain that the bond is sealed by an act of sacrilege and rebellion in which the debtera betrays the teachings of the church. ... In the case of debtera, it seems that the Almighty is usually unwilling to postpone retribution until the afterlife, and errant debtera are likely victims for a variety of stigmatizing afflictions. Some are shrunken into achondroplasia, others are turned into humpbacks, some become blind, and others suffer withering of arms and legs. Most often, it is through the agency of the debtera ’s own familiars that the Almighty chooses to punish him."
t0299 cite0009 MP05 "Although most Amhara can identify the grosser body organs by name, even the knowledgeable anatomist can assign functions to only a few of these."
t0300 cite0006 MP05 "In his role as magician, the t’enqway is called k’wama (from k’om[unknown] , he stood up), since he tries to identify the personality of the evil spirit from his abode; e.g. in the water of a brook, or a waterhole in the river, or under a certain tree, etc. The magician is also considered an expert on fire and lightning. When a person is struck by lightning, m[unknown]br[unknown]k’ , the priests consider it heavenly punishment, and in the past even refused to bury the victim in the churchyard; thus the t’enqway is called in. His treatment consists of moving the victim quickly to the fireplace - he regards fire and warm ashes as the counteracting principle. If a house is on fire in town, it is still believed that the magician, standing on the roof of a neighboring house with a mirror, can prevent the spreading of the fire by causing the flames to recoil."
t0301 cite0009 MP05 "A woman who excludes zar s from her disease etiologies assumes great vulnerabilities. Without zar familiars, she must build etiologies from the mortal intentions of sorcerers, poisoners, and ganel s. Against these agents, a woman can generally afford to raise only weak prophylactic defenses, and the cost of expert therapy (by an awakiy debtera ) is usually beyond her slender means. Unmarried townswomen are particularly vulnerable in this regard, since they are without interested mates to purchase necessary debtera therapy or to insist on etiologies consistent with the teachings of the Church."
t0302 cite0004 MP05 "But for serious trouble—when someone has been afflicted by a zar or infected by a buda —the folk wisdom does not suffice, and a specialist is sought. The tanquay, or “sorcerer,” is consulted for exorcising demons as well as for physical ailments. In treating a zar patient his task is to discern, by clever interrogation, what manner of zar is riding the patient and then to determine what sort of gift is required to propitiate this zar . For a patient who has been “eaten” by the evil eye, he may succeed in summoning the guilty buda —identified when the patient calls out his name during a trance—and inducing him to spit on his victim; or he may resort to such techniques as transferring the demon from the victim to the body of a chicken and then killing the chicken. The [unknown]tanquay has other supernatural powers. He can summon the devil to liquidate the enemy of a client. He can interpret dreams and predict the future. For this he boils coffee, burns incense, and, sitting on a white sheepskin with freshly cut grass spread about the room, speaks out whatever comes to him."
t0303 cite0004 MP05 "Counter to this conservative drag, on the other hand, is the peasant’s powerful desire for one basic change in his life circumstances, namely, the reduction of morbidity and mortality. Despite his idyllic conception of paradise and his frequent contention that life on earth is something of little value, the Amhara wants to avoid death. Even from the religious point of view he is [Page 90] motivated to live as long as possible: the monk wants to live longer in order to get closer to God by prayer, and the worldly man wants to live long enough to atone for his sins so that he may enter paradise. Health thus rates as one of the most important values. The expressions for greeting and farewell stress health. Most of the prayers and vows offered have to do with achieving health. Long, painful pilgrimages are made for cures, and much money is spent for the remedies of native practitioners and for amulets to ward off illness. This powerful desire for health and life operates as a lever to overcome the resistance to change."
t0303 cite0004 MP05 "Toward the bearers of new ideas designed to satisfy this desire for reduced morbidity and mortality, however, the peasant’s stance is suspicious and unsympathetic at the outset. He regards Ethiopians who have been educated by Westerners as contaminated by alien norms and beliefs. They appear to him as Ethiopians, but also as strangers—as “black faranj ”—with their European clothes and their unorthodox eating and smoking habits. He tends to distrust their motives, to suspect them of being out to take advantage of him in some way. And he resents their overt or implicit disparagement of his way of life, particularly his practices in so sensitive an area as sanitation."
t0303 cite0004 MP05 "Against such obstacles one cultural factor that serves to present the health worker as an acceptable agent of change is the Amhara peasant’s deference to the man of learning. The public health worker is in a position to inherit some of the awe felt for the learned dabtara, especially since the health teams operate out of centers which provide therapy as well as instruction, which gives them the benefit of association with the quasi-magical powers attributed to one who performs successful treatment. In addition, he can be aided by the Amhara peasant’s personal devotion to someone who has helped him and won his confidence. Whether this devotion can be stimulated depends, in the last analysis, on the character and resourcefulness of the public health workers themselves. Those who are able to communicate in a dignified manner with the peasants, who avoid dealing with them as an inferior and backward people, who refrain from flaunting the most important local norms, and who are on good terms with local authorities and respected men, have a substantial chance of being accepted after an initial period of suspicion and alienation. Thus it was that a Gojjami peasant, asked why some of the local people were hearkening to the advice of the public health team at Dabra Marqos, explained: “We have come to realize that what you tell us to do is for our own advantage, not yours.” Elsewhere in Gojjam, a similar response was the eventual issue of a more pronounced initial rejection of public health workers. In the village of Dajan doors were closed against a venereal disease team which was taking blood samples of the entire population for Kahn test analysis. Popular suspicion was voiced in a number of ways; the health workers were accused of selling blood, of being missionaries, and of otherwise trying [Page 91] to cheat the locals. The health officer in charge of the team then brought some of the objectors to the mobile laboratory, patiently explained what was going on, and how it would benefit the people. Before long word got around that these outsiders were not so evil after all, and the doors of Dajan opened."
t0304 cite0006 MP05 "Many ailments are regarded by the Amhara as closely interwoven in the body and spirit of the patient, and in fact, frequently no sharp distinction is made between bodily and spiritual ailments, so that the same illness may sometimes be treated by the surgeon-herbologist ( w[unknown]ge[unknown]sa ), and if not successfully cured, by the practitioner of exorcising magic, the debtera scribe, or the practitioner of sympathetic magic of the zar cult, or even the sorcerer, the t’[unknown]nk’way . Only the latter is considered illegal. However, a fairly clear distinction is made between organic ailments and functional ailments, and on the basis of whichever preliminary diagnosis is made, it is decided which practitioner to call in first."
t0304 cite0006 MP05 "The association of the debtera with the church has increased his activities in recent years from that of amulet-writer and herbologist to many of the functions of outright magic, particularly since the tenqway has become illegal. The debtera always seems to have enjoyed the highest respectability and trust of any of the practitioners, since (as in ancient Greece), his activity in the official religion is believed to extend over the ills of the body and over the world of the spirits. There is no philosophical basis for the development of medical systems among the Amhara, thus no reasoned system. Their medical concepts are pre-Galen, at most Aristotelian. The debtera have, or in some cases claim to have, books handed down from past centuries, containing secret formulae, recipes, pharmacopeia of an intermingled empirical and magical nature. They warn inquirers that the public revelation of these secrets would create great social dangers at the hands of the irresponsible."
t0305 cite0006 MP05 "Violent forms of possession may manifest themselves by aggression directed against the patient himself, such as beating himself, hitting the head against the wall, eating [Page 304] dirt, trying to climb the wall, wanting to run out at night to roam with hyenas. In some cases, if accompanied by nosebleed, or “weeping blood”, this is diagnosed as buda and becomes a case for the debtera practitioner. In cases of running amok, with aggression directed against others, it may be diagnosed as ganen (jinn) and be treated either by the debtera, zar doctor, or t’enqway sorcerer."
t0306 cite0009 MP05 "Amhara healer and layman use common sets of physiological and pathological notions; neither physiology nor pathology is conceived as a coherent body of knowledge in its own right, however. The Amhara does not often verbalize these notions, and, when he does, it is in ad hoc contexts, generally intrinsic to the selection of prophylaxis or the administration of therapy. Thus, set down on the following pages as discrete subjects, Amhara physiology and pathology appear as collections of relatively simple notions, and of limited explanatory power when compared with the medical systems of other historical civilizations. Unlike those systems, the organization of Amhara medical beliefs and practices is dominated by concepts of practitioner power, its sources and its therapeutic and prophylactic expressions."
t0307 cite0009 MP05 "Such differences of opinion [about magical vs. natural etiology, which can look identical regardless of pathogenic agent and whether or not it was done intentionally by an agent] are generally of little consequence, for they have neither real therapeutic significance nor importance in non-medical contexts. Practitioners are chosen on their record of success (as well as their availability and cost), rather than according to any ‘theoretical’ criteria. Thus a scabies sufferer may obtain the services of a yimic medhaniyt korac (lit., “medicament outter for gerifta”) even though he believes, in the abstract at least, that the ailment is produced by likift . Most herbalist-names signify only the ailment which the therapist treats (e.g., the yianfula medhaniyt korac , treats anfula ), and the client may not know the specific etiological details to which the practitioner subscribes. There is, however, an exception to the one etiology-one disease name identification: Almost any ailment can be explained as the result of ganel or zar attentions (etiology of type E), particularly if it is serious, chronic, unyielding to treatment, or exhibits aberrant symptoms. Some ailments (e.g., apoplexy) are explained only by reference to this type of etiology."
t0308 cite0009 MP05 "Where the introjected pathogen is the self-conscious agent found in etiology C (i.e., the buda ), the strategy remains essentially the same. However, the practitioner must, in dialogue with the disease agent, convince the buda to quit the sickman. To this end, the practitioner uses a fumitory offensive to the introjected agent. Ailments of type D etiology (i.e., mers , poison) impose a special requirement on the therapist. There are numerous toxic formulae, and, although all produce similar symptomatic [Page 26] effects, each is believed to be complemented by a unique antidote. Cure therefore demands that the poison be identified in order for the antidote to be obtained."
t0309 cite0009 MP05 "The dental wogey[unknown]sa is known as a “ yiters medhaniyt awlakiy ”. As with other wogey[unknown]sa -treated ailments, toothache can be traced to multiple causes, whose identification is only marginally important to the practitioner. Toothache is caused either by sun-borne gerifta or by an intrusive worm whose presence is made apparent by the caries it bores out. The ultimate and most successful therapy of the yiters medhaniyt awlakiy is extraction, with the use of European dental pliers. Because of the pain associated with this operation, laymen often [Page 40] use local applications of commonly known palliatives, until subsequent discomfort obliges them to consult a tooth extractor. 3"
t0309 cite0009 MP05 "In the abstract, these palliatives (distilled spirits known as arakiy and ginger root) are only effective against the intrusive worm, but in reality they are used even when evidence of the worm agent ( til ), i.e., caries, are not apparent."
t0309 cite0009 MP05 "In addition to simple toothache ( yiters himem ), gerifta may result in rheumatoid pain ( kurtimat ) in the cheek teeth and adjacent jaw, accompanied by swollen, itching gums. Although herbal poultices are available for this syndroms, only tooth extraction promises permanent relief. The yiters medhaniyt awlakiy also treats the newly irrupted teeth of year-old infants. The upper lateral incisors are believed to often cause infants severe pain, resulting in incessant crying, diarrhea and failure to suckle properly. To remedy this dangerous situation, the practitioner removes the offending teeth using an awl-like implement. In each of these dental operations, kusil is considered no real danger, and prophylaxis is not given."
t0310 cite0009 MP05 "The cupper is unique among lay practitioners in several respects. First, he occasionally works under the direction of another category of practitioner, the tagan ( wogey[unknown]sa ). Second, there are special physical requirements; the agamiy must have all of his incisors, and the upper and lower teeth must meet in an unbroken plane. Third, the agamiy exposes himself to certain dangers in the performance of this therapy. Because he must remove a pathogenic substance through the medium of the sickman’s blood, there is the danger that, should any of the blood enter his own mouth, the agamiy may himself fall ill with the ailment he is treating. In addition, contact with this blood threatens those chronic ailments from which the sickman suffers (such as the rheumatoid pains associated with kitin , syphilis)."
t0311 cite0009 MP05 "The type of practitioner that a client consults influences the final etiology with which his disease episode is finally rationalized. In the context of category three ailments, the awakiy debtera is a morally correct choice for the male client, since his therapy is capable of translating the disease episode into a confirmation of the client’s normative social state. Failing more innocuous indications (generally involving ganel s), the debtera ’s diagnosis and cure are expected to support an etiology of sorcery or poisoning. This marks the sick-man as someone’s talat ; a man someone wishes to kill or maim in retribution or fear; a man who has incurred a talat ’s interest by demonstrating aggressive and proud (i.e., masculine) behavior, by committing assault and murder, by usurping land rights, or by contesting sexual access to women."
t0312 cite0010 FK07 "Shortly afterwards, the king caught a very painful disease which made his legs swell. This was the cause of the disease: One day while he was at his capital of Nyanjeradde, Kinyolo told him of a lame but very expert doctor. “If I fetch him,” claimed Kinyolo, “he will cast such a powerful spell against Kakungulu, that he will never invade Buganda again.” When he heard this, Semakookiro sent Kinyolo to Buzongola to fetch the doctor. “The king wants you,” Kinyolo told the man on his arrival at Buzongola. The doctor accepted the invitation, but he also proposed that before he could go to Buganda with Kinyolo, they would first of all make a blood brotherhood. 10"
t0312 cite0010 FK07 "So as to protect himself against betrayal."
t0312 cite0010 FK07 "As soon as it was made they left for Buganda and on their arrival, the doctor gave the king a fetish and declared: “Kakungulu will never invade Buganda again because I have cast a spell against him.” After giving this fetish to the king, Kigulu the doctor asked for leave to return to his own country. But before he left, the king told Kinyolo: “You must drown him in the lake, lest Kakungulu hears of him and consults him also.” At first Kinyolo refused to kill his “blood brother”, but the king threatened him that, should he refuse, he must never return to Buganda. Because of these threats, Kinyolo agreed to drown the doctor and when they reached the river Kagera, he was thrown in and got drowned."
t0313 cite0011 FK07 "When a man fell sick, his wife immediately consulted the nearest medicine-man, who came, and by consulting the oracle was able to tell what was the cause of the sickness, and also to prescribe for the patient. If he was suffering from headache only, the usual remedy was to bleed him, in order to relieve him of the alien matter introduced into his head by means of magic, or by some ghost. When the cup was removed, the blood was poured into a leaf, and examined by the medicine-man, who invariably found something which had been drawn out in the cupping-process to account for the headache. The method of cupping was to apply one, and sometimes two cups, as the case demanded: these were short ends of horns, generally the tips of cows’ horns about three inches long; at the tip a small hole was made, to create a vacuum. The medicine-man shaved the hair from the side of the head, if he meant to cup the head; washed the place with [Page 100] water; took a sharp knife and made a number of scratches or slight incisions; again wetted the place over the scratches, applied the cup to the head, and sucked out the air, having in his mouth a little plug of leaf or grass, which he put into the hole, while still sucking out the air. For headache he usually cupped in two places, one on either side of the head. Cupping was practised for headache, for coughs (when they cupped the lungs on the back), for deep seated abscesses in the arms and legs, and sometimes for pleurisy in the side. The horns were left on the patient, until the medicine-man thought that he had drawn enough blood. In other kinds of illness the medicine-man who threw the pieces of leather was consulted, and prescribed for the patient. ... The remedies applied were often herbs which skilled medicine-men had found useful, for though a medicine-man worked magic, yet he also administered drugs, and did his utmost to relieve the sick person, and to retain his own reputation as a doctor. In some kinds of illness it was thought advisable to apply a small burning iron, made of three pieces of iron about a quarter of an inch thick and four inches long, which were welded together at one end, and pointed to a spike fitting into a wooden handle, so that it could be put into the fire, and made quite hot, and applied to the place where the pain was. Three blisters were usually made, which were supposed to give relief, and above all to drive out the cause of the pain. For fever the medicine-men administered herbs, which had to be drunk from one of the fetiches; this was said to increase their potency. Phthisis was always said to be caused by the ghost of some ancestor who had died of the complaint, and unless the ghost could be propitiated, it would kill the patient. The expectorations from such a person were greatly dreaded as being a channel for the [Page 101] ghost’s malign influence over any one who came into contact therewith."
t0314 cite0011 FK07 "When a man’s wife, or one of his children, was ill, he would sometimes take the fetich Nambaga outside his hut by night, and, holding it in one hand, would smoke upon it furiously, until the fetich possessed him, and gave him information as to the cause of the illness, and the treatment which he ought to adopt. Only the most skilled medicine-man could make fetiches; herbs had to be carefully selected, and other materials were needed, such as the hearts of lions, leopards, crocodiles, elephants, buffaloes, and other animals, which (it was supposed) would make the owner brave and strong. These materials were pounded together and stuffed into the horns, or they were mixed with clay, made into fetiches, and dedicated by the medicine-man to different gods. They thus became identified with a supernatural being, and in consequence they were possessed by the gods, and were powerful and effective. The secret of making these fetiches was confined to a small number of medicine-men who never divulged it to others, unless they themselves were to reap some benefit by the communication. The people believed that these objects had supernatural powers, they paid large sums of money for them, and treated them with the utmost respect and reverence."
t0315 cite0012 FK07 "[During the initiation of the prophet] the prophet was first marked out for his career by the choice of the lubale, manifested in his possession by the spirit, but he could not begin to prophesy till he had been ceremonially initiated by an older practitioner. The usual signs of possession by a lubale were different from those of possession by a muzimu . The person concerned “ went mad ”, wandered about in a distraught manner, and slept out of doors. It was also possible, especially in the case of a child, for an illness of any kind, which ordinary means failed to cure, to be interpreted as due to this cause. The theory seems to be that the lubale, having selected a person as its mouthpiece, becomes angry when he does not prophesy and tries to kill him, and that the illness is the result."
t0316 cite0013 FK07 "The Baganda do not, as a rule, believe that there is a western medicine for treating epilepsy, because it is a Kiganda illness. Out of 83 cases of epilepsy whom I saw in the rural area, only eight had tried to obtain some help from western medicine. Out of these only two had understood the necessity for continuing the medicine indefinitely, but had been unable to afford to fetch it each month. Two others had obtained treatment from private practitioners and one from a chemist, but these had not understood that they needed to return for more. One had been in Butabika Hospital because of associated violent madness and another had attended the local dispensary and been asked to attend Mulago Hospital but had never gone there. The remaining case had got as far as attending [Page 46] Mulago Hospital but says he was told there that the medicine for this illness “was not easily obtained” and so came away empty handed. Most cases in fact had never even thought of getting western medicine, while others were quite emphatic that, up to my coming, there had never been medicine available. I heard of a few instances in which there was a definite feeling against trying to get western medicine. It was difficult to trace such cases and the reasons for such an attitude can only be surmised. Shame and the possibility of ridicule at being turned away without treatment are more likely to be a reason than fear that such an action may anger any spirits causing the illness."
t0317 cite0014 FL12 "Girls' Initiation .--Among the Masai girls are initiated singly and not in groups, nor are they initiated until a good many years after puberty, for as soon as a girl is initiated she must be married, and cease to have any intercourse with the warriors or boys. Except under the circumstances described above, a girl is not initiated until her breasts begin to droop to a marked extent. As soon as this is noticeable, her mother informs the father, who makes the necessary arrangements. If the girl's mother is living at the time at a manyatta with one of her sons, then the girl's initiation will take place at the manyatta , otherwise it will take place at the home village. The essential point is that initiation must take place in the mother's hut (or in the hut of another of her father's wives, should her own mother be dead). The father comes to the place when the day of the ceremony has been fixed and beer is prepared. A ram called olekelnjatha is slaughtered either before the actual operation or just after it. This is the “ram for childbearing,” and is supposed to insure fertility. This ram is eaten by all those present at the ceremony. The actual operation is performed by an old woman, who is a skilled operator (she may be either a Masai or a Dorobo), and the girl sits on a skin inside the hut during the operation. The operation is said to be the same as that used by the Kikuyu on their girls, and this is a form of clitoridectomy, but exact details cannot be obtained from the men. As soon as the operation is over the operator washes the girl to “cleanse her of the blood spilt” and a ram is then slaughtered and given to the operator. This ram is called oletuguet . Next a ram is killed called olkelelarlat to provide meat and fat for the girl during convalescence."
t0318 cite0015 FL12 "The ordeal for the initiate begins from the time that he is made aware of the possibility of flinching as a painful thought. He has years to prime himself for something that can never quite be known until it has been experienced. This is the third source of anxiety and it also bears on the fate of the circumciser who faces a different ordeal. It is believed that if no boy [Page 73] flinches in the course of a season of initiations, then the circumciser will meet an early death. This is one reason why no Maasai would normally accept the task, and it is usually undertaken by a skilled man from elsewhere who is prepared to take the risk. He is despised as a scavenger, a dorobo , whose greed for the payment outweighs his prudence. It is therefore in his interest to retain a reputation for skill, while making this a painful operation in the hope that he may snick some hidden nerve and cause an involuntary twitch. Technically, the initiate would have flinched even if someone inadvertently nudges him, and his kinsmen are said to watch the operation very closely: the initiate for signs of a twitch, the circumciser for some dirty trick, and any spectator close by who might nudge him. Sometimes they may even form a close protective ring round the operation to keep possible ill-wishers at bay (cf. Fox 1931:191)."
t0319 cite0016 MO04 "Much specialized botanical and meteorological knowledge is conserved in traditions specific to each region of the country. Virtually every nomadic clan has its recognized weather-lore experts (cilmicurraaf) . These are usually older men who have inherited knowledge of astronomy, meteorology, and animal husbandry from their forebears and who, during their own lifetimes, keep records of drought, rainfall patterns, and the changing qualities of the grazing areas [Page 44] frequented by their kinsmen. Their advice is often encapsulated in poetry or sayings of the following sort:"

Lambs conceived on that night will be born about 150 days later, which should be in the middle of the gu (spring) rains."
t0320 cite0016 MO04 "Although most of the calculations of the weather-lore expert are grounded in experience and empirical observation, he is also usually something of a forecaster and astrologer. The following saying from the Mudug region of central Somalia is typical of the expert’s predictions:"
t0320 cite0016 MO04 "The year of the successful rains is that in which Dirir [the star Arcturus] is slightly behind the moon in the early part of the night but in which the two become parallel in the sky throughout the second half of the night. In the calculus of pastoral decision-making, the weather-lorist is frequently consulted and his wisdom highly regarded. His expertise helps insure that nomadic groups are operating in an environment that has been well-charted by experience and tradition."
t0321 cite0017 MO04 "This method [of computing lunar months], quite ingenious, as is seen, is, however, only the popular one. It serves for the current use of the Bedouins, who are able to be sufficiently well informed on the whole about the beginning of the season of the rains, when they do not want or are not able to have recourse to the wad[unknown]ad, expert on the stars for the tribe, for advice. This combination, then, in the reckoning of the Mussulman calendar with the Somali one is noteworthy, since it demonstrates, on the one hand, the continuous diffusion of Islamic culture, and, on the other hand, the practical reasons for which the Somali solar year remains in use today."
t0321 cite0017 MO04 "The method by stellar observations is more complex; it was easy to get information, because it is a part of the ‘knowledge of the tribe,’ which, however, is threatened more every day by the progress of Islam."
t0322 cite0017 MO04 "On the other hand, it is necessary to consider that this method of the Migiurtinis is used by the wadâd of the tribes, as I said at the beginning, and the divisions of the year for such a purpose are known only by the ‘star experts’ in the tribes, whereas in the common usages of life -- within the solar year -- the dates are fixed by the lunations, which have -- in turn -- Somali names. Thus, for example, within the solar year that goes from one ‘feast of fire’ to another, none of the Migiurtini fixes a date indicating it, as, let us say, the 5th 222 of musarêmo or the 7th of fu[unknown]sádi, but rather one sooner speaks of the fifth day, for example, of the lunation of sidetâl (= [unknown] [unknown]) or of the fourth day of the lunation of dágo (= [unknown]). It is understood, on the other hand, that the learned man who wants to calculate the beginning and the end of the rains must know the correspondence between the days of the lunation and those of the periods of the solar year."
t0322 cite0017 MO04 "Now in this state of things it seems not improbable that the ancient division of the solar year into groups of decades, which has fallen out of use among the tribes and continues to be used only by the “star experts,” has been partially perfected by the latter with those new divisions based on direct stellar observations, which form the second half of the actual solar year of the Migiurtinis. But it is not easy to find a precise solution for this little problem, since it also might be that the two systems (year divided into groups of decades and year calculated on the occultations of Spica) have in the past coexisted integrally -- the one as a popular system and the other one as learned system -- and that then, both driven back (I shall speak thus) into the limited field of the ‘knowledge of the tribe,’ they have been combined into the present method of the Migiurtini “star experts.”"

t0324 cite0018 MO04 "6. A meteorologist, and"
t0324 cite0018 MO04 "7. A soothsayer."
t0324 cite0018 MO04 "These roles are explained in the following paragraphs"
t0325 cite0018 MO04 "In the first place, the weather lore expert knows fairly well the locations and paths of the major celestial bodies -- including the visible planets, the sun, the moon, and a large number of constellations and clusters of stars. The positions and changes of these bodies are interpreted in manners relative to Somali life. Some of these interpretations are astrological in nature. For example, the eclipse of the Moon is said to fortell the death of a renoun leader; and that of the sun, a prosperous year. Moreover, a child born on certain nights when the Moon is adjacent to certain stars is thought to be evil; yet if born on other nights, he is considered virtuous. But the greater part of the interpretations of these bush weather lorists is logical, and in many cases pragmatic. Their inductions are based on:"
t0325 cite0018 MO04 "a) information handed down from past experts, for which they are the record keepers;"
t0325 cite0018 MO04 "b) personal observation of the positions and changes of those celestial bodies."
t0325 cite0018 MO04 "In this way, then, the weather lore expert acts as a combination of astrologer and astronomer."
t0326 cite0018 MO04 "The weather lorist is also an expert on the grazing and care of animals--he is a pastoral geographer. He knows what areas are best for grazing at what time of year; he knows what grasses are best for the animals; and he knows what type of earth will support these grasses. He knows which wells give the best water for animals. He must be on constant watch against water that contains HHANFALEY (poison). 3"
t0326 cite0018 MO04 ". Somali pastoral veterinary doctors think the poison is caused by roots of certain plants making their way down into the water table. The most dangerous plant is called CADAY. This, interestingly enough, is the tree whose roots and branches are used throughout Somalia as toothbrushes. CADAY is found in salty or gypseous country."
t0326 cite0018 MO04 "On certain years, certain wells will contain HHANFALEY. The weather lore expert must keep record of which wells will be potentially poisonous each year. He knows this through keeping account of which flocks were lost, both where and when. He then goes to the well and tastes its water. If he is uncertain still, he will test the water with one goat. Still doubting, he will advise his kinsmen not to use the well at all. So the expert must be very conscientious in his role as a geographer."
t0327 cite0018 MO04 "The pastoral expert is also a meteorologist. He understands the winds and their changes, the rains and their sugnificant influences on the flocks of animals and on the lives of people, both nomads and agriculturists. One miscalculation by the weather expert can upset the Somalis’ entire way of life. If, for example, the special night of DAMBASAMO, when rams are permitted to mate with ewes, is miscalculated, the kids may be born at the wrong time of year. If they are born during the dry season, they as well as their mother may die for lack of grazing and water. In short, the weather lorist bears a lot of responsibility towards his kinsmen."
t0328 cite0018 MO04 "In calculating the HABEYNTIRIS, the weather lore expert’s role as a record keeper comes most into play. One of his most important services is to keep an accurate record of the calendar. In our research, we have discovered that the country falls into seven district regions. The experts of these weather districts have their own unique terminology describing the seasons and lunar months, as well as the Stations of the Moon, elaborated in an above section. The districts are numbered (1) to (7) in the map in Appendix 9.3."
t0329 cite0018 MO04 "Perhaps the most important means for passing the knowledge of the weather lore expert from generation to generation is the medium of sayings, maxims, and riddles. Though I have included many of these in the above text, in my ongoing research I am constantly finding new ones, or having old ones brought to mind. These I include in this special section... [poem, plus mention of:] h) To study a way of collecting together at intervals the few living Somali weather experts"
t0330 cite0019 MO04 "Although burji is very loosely defined in daily discourse there are experts who have a more elaborate understanding of the concept. These are the religious specialists, the wadaado or culmadda . Burji is seen as a part of the area of competence of these men; i.e. the cilmi or religious knowledge. It is significant that this connection is made, because cilmi is conceived of as distinct from knowledge of worldly matters, kasmo or caqli . 4. Cilmi itself is of course far from uniform; as pointed out by Cassanelli (1975) there exists in the history of Somali Islam a distinct contrast between what he calls a mystical and a theocratic tradition. We will here only be concerned with the mystical tradition, the best general introduction to which is Lewis 1955/56."
t0330 cite0019 MO04 "Cilmi and kasmo , religious and mundane knowledge, belong to entirely separate spheres of thought and action. In two important papers, Lewis has analysed this dualism further within the contexts of notions of power and of role stereotypes (Lewis 1963, 1965). As he aptly summarizes his findings, Somali do not validate secular supremacy in religious or secular terms, but rather...see mundane and religious power as counter-poised, and... assume that one is present where the other is absent . [Lewis 1963:115, emphasis added]... I found that people had [Page 93] difficulty explaining the term other than by relating examples of it, often drawn from their own experiences. It was said: “when a boy falls in love with a girl but feels that something stops him from approaching her, then it is her burji that is bigger than his”. Similarly, I was told that “the one who can always persuade others to agree with his propositions, it is his burji that helps him”."
t0331 cite0019 MO04 "Having talked about what burji is not related to, I must turn now to what it is related to. There is a distinctly religious element to the notions concerning the individual. Not only is individual honour (in the sense described above) directly associated with religious values, but when asking questions about burji itself, most of my informants directed me to the religious experts. I was told that burji is a large and complicated concept but that those men who possess astrological knowledge ( xiddigis ), secret religious knowledge ( asraar or cilmi sireed ) and religious knowledge in general ( cilmi ) also have holy books where the secrets of burji are revealed."
t0332 cite0019 MO04 "The knowledge of burji possessed by the religious experts is indeed much more specialized and technical than that possessed by laymen. According to the experts there are twelve different, named burji . To find out which burji a person has, his name is written with Arabic characters and the position numbers assigned to each one of the characters within the Arabic alphabet are then added together. The sum reached is by further calculations made to correspond with the number of a burji ..."
t0332 cite0019 MO04 "Burji is also connected with what was called “the small stars”. In Arabic they are known as manaazil and there are 28 of them. Each one of these stars is linked to one of the characters of the Arabic alphabet, and through this link, it was claimed, another connection between the name of a person and his burji can be established. The “small stars” are dependants of, or “soldiers of”, the seven “big stars” (in Arabic kawaakib ). These, in turn, are related to each one of the seven heavens, and they are also related to different prophets. Because of this latter link, a person can be informed about which one of the prophets is “his”. The 28 small stars can be further rearranged into four groups with seven stars in each. Each one of these four groups is [Page 98] related to one of the four seasons and, therefore, the different burji are linked to the seasons too. In addition, some of the experts are able to establish a connection between the burji of a person and a day of the week. Such days may be said to be the proper day to pursue various difficult tasks."
t0333 cite0019 MO04 "This system, then, is both enormously complex and suggestive of a fascinating system of cosmic correspondences such as that described for the northern Somali by Galaal (1968). It should be stressed, however, that none of the experts I consulted knew other than fragmentary bits of it by heart. Throughout the interviews they had to consult their documents and notes on the subject, and even so many questions remained unanswered. Furthermore, the answers I got from one expert frequently contradicted the answers of another. I should also mention that there were tendencies among the experts to make the subject even more “mystical” than it already appeared. For instance, all names of the stars and of the different burji etc. were consequently given in Arabic even for those that have Somali names. This shroud of obscurity and mysticism in which the knowledge of burji is dressed is of course particularly significant in view of the transparency of genealogical, agnatic knowledge. The property of obscurity may be seen as a semantically particularly powerful one. It can only be identified as such, however, when contrasted with non-obscure categories."
t0334 cite0019 MO04 "One of the many applications that the scholarly knowledge of burji has is to determine whether it is appropriate to marry a specific person. In such contexts one can observe how the fluidity of the system gives rise to a big variation in the interpretations offered. Sometimes the name of the potential wife will be used to derive a specific burji . It may be shown that this burji is related to jilaal , the dry-season, and is thus indicative of her possible infertility. In other cases, the sum of the wife’s name is subtracted from that of her husband. The result may be a “female” burji which may be taken to mean that the marriage, if it should come about, will only be blessed with daughters. On the other hand, the same burji may be related to the star qalbi , heart, a possible sign that the wife will love her husband dearly. I have also witnessed how the same basic facts are given a different interpretation on another occasion. [Page 99] These examples show that there are generous margins within this system of correspondences and the number of possible interpretations appears to be infinite."
t0334 cite0019 MO04 "This applies not only to contexts of marriage, but one can note the very same tendencies of a “looseness” in the interpretations within every possible area of application. I am not the only one to make such observations. Many informants admitted that what the experts said did not always seem to be internally consistent. However, to them this fact underscored that burji is a complicated subject. Some people also took this opportunity to deliver a cautious criticism of the local experts by calling them kitaab gablow or Yaasiinleh , terms that imply that these men have only been taught a tiny fraction of the Koran. It is true that some experts I consulted did not enjoy a generous reputation for their learning. However, many of them were regionally recognized shaikhs, trained in Baardheere or in other reputable institutes of religious learning. The fact remains that detected inconsistencies only seem to amplify the belief that the system of knowledge concerning burji is one of obscure, hidden truths. As Simmel has suggested, the use of secrecy offers the possibility of a second world alongside the manifest world (Simmel 1950:330). The glimpses of truth believed to be contained in the fragmented knowledge of burji has an indisputable quality of such otherworldliness."
t0335 cite0019 MO04 "Discussing Somali medical plants, one should be careful not to underestimate the accumulation of practical knowledge which may underlie their use. Lewis writes that “in enquiring . . . why a certain plant was supposed to have curative powers . . . I was usually told that it had been tried and found to be efficacious” (1961:26-27). However, the use of plants is not confined to purely medical purposes. “Herbalists” are also thought of as knowledgeable about sorcery (sexir) . In Southern Somalia it is widely believed that the population along the river-valleys are particularly skilled herbalists. Those traditionally engaged in the ferrying across the river are held to possess a knowledge of herbs by which they control the wild animals such as crocodiles and hippos. These men, who are called baxaari, enjoy considerable recognition far beyond their home villages. Among the Hubeer these baxaari are regarded as belonging to the inferior groups of common (boon) descent, who are further described in the next chapter."
t0336 cite0019 MO04 "Few herbalists claim to master this method fully. It is generally believed that the method is mostly used by those endogamous social groups who are descendants of slaves or who are outcasts. The baxaari, whom I have mentioned, is such a group, but in every Southern Somali village there are groups or individuals with a corresponding social position. Just like the baxaari such people may have an inferior social position and be feared for their magical skills, although they are often only talked about as dhiryaqaan, “the one who knows about herbs”..."
t0336 cite0019 MO04 "We should note here, then, that there is some connection between the lower levels of society and knowledge of medical plants. This does not imply that the plants as such are seen as belonging to these groups, nor that using plants for curative purposes is defiling, only that certain socially peripheral groups are often [Page 109] believed to be particularly skilled in handling them. A commonly held view on why it is precisely these groups that are knowledgeable in the use of plants, is that they allegedly are less religious than other Somalis, and that this has forced them to seek another type of knowledge. Lewis (1963; 1965) has also suggested that one can view these groups’ connection with sorcery as a kind of compensation for their lack of political influence."
t0336 cite0019 MO04 "It should be emphasized that although, at times, knowledge of the more esoteric usage of medical plants times is associated with the socially inferior, the plants themselves are seen as connected with the place where they grow. The spatial category duur, the bush, connotes the anti-social, the dangerous and the wild. The very word duur is used in constructions such as duurgelid, “to become completely mad”, and duur-xul, “to talk in an obscure way”. Duur is the sphere of the wild animals (dugaag) while domesticated animals (xoola) belong to the sphere of the village and “civilization” (ilbaxnimmo) . If a herbalist is consulted only to get advice on what plant should be used for a certain purpose, he will usually stress that the plant in question should be obtained from “a distant place” (meel fog ah) . In markets one finds surprisingly little commerce with medical plants. One reason, an informant suggested, is that they must be “fresh” (dhay) to have any “effect” - faa’ido . A guarantee for faa’ido is that the patient picks the plant himself or that the herbalist does it in connection with the treatment."
t0336 cite0019 MO04 "The latter method is also the most common one in cases where an expert is consulted. The expert himself supplies the patient with those plants or parts of plants that are needed in the treatment. If they require any form of preparation or extraction he will see to that too. The administration of the cure is also supervised by the herbalist. If repeated administration is necessary, the herbalist will usually stay overnight at the patient’s home or return there with the medicine when it is time. If he asks a direct question, the patient will usually be told the name of the plant being administered. However, experts will not volunteer such information and they frequently attempt to conceal the exact method of preparation. ..."
t0336 cite0019 MO04 "In summary, knowledge about medical plants is to some extent linked with an inferior and dangerous social status. Furthermore, the plants are associated with the spatial category of duur, bush, and are seen as especially powerful when they come from distant places. I have also pointed out that there is a tendency to keep knowledge of medical plants to oneself. This fact would seem to contribute to the reproduction of the knowledge of geed as a distinct area of knowledge."
t0337 cite0019 MO04 "Turning now to the religion, diin, it should be observed that in religious forms of treatment there is a greater emphasis on the role of the expert than is the case with the herbal treatments. While there is a considerable amount of competence with regards to medical plants among laymen, people are more inclined to turn directly to an expert in cases where they prefer a “religious” cure for a disease."
t0337 cite0019 MO04 "The emphasis given to the religious experts does not only apply to contexts of healing. In Somali society there is a profound dichotomization of phenomena associated with religion and phenomena seen as profane or mundane. Ideally every Somali man is thought of as either a warranleh, a spear-bearer, or as a wadaad, a man of religion. In the same way religious knowledge, cilmi, is separate from knowledge of worldly matters, called dhuug or caqli . The religion is seen as providing a system of non-disputable norms which stand opposed to the worldly and debatable norms. Cultural and customary decrees (dhaqan) may be explicitly contrasted with what is required by the religion (diin) . To express that something is “compulsory” or khasab means [Page 111] that it is prescribed by the religion. In traditional courts one can also find conflicts about which set of standards should be applied: is the verdict to be given in conformity with the Islamic law ( sharciiya ) or should Somali customary law ( xeer soomaaliyeed ) be used? These facts form a necessary background for understanding the integrity of religious phenomena and the way in which “religion” is seen as an independent system (see Chapter 3)."
t0338 cite0019 MO04 "A more advanced form of religious therapy requires greater knowledge. A distinct trait of the therapy offered by the more skilled experts is that people in general do not fully comprehend how they go about it, nor are they expected to. Advanced religious therapy is based on certain concepts of the individual which are called burji . As I have described in Chapter 4 this is the astral constellation a person is born in and it also implies that the person possesses a certain potential force. For curing disease, and also for curing conditions such as childlessness or to establish contact with the opposite sex, the task for the [Page 112] appointed wadaad is to alter the burji of the person so that the disease is defeated, or so that other desired effects result. Knowledge of somebody’s burji can be gained either by knowing his date of birth or by using the person’s name with the name of his mother added. If the latter procedure is chosen the names are written in Arabic and the position numbers assigned to each one of the characters in the Arabic alphabet are then added together. This sum is by further calculations made to correspond with the number of a particular burji ."
t0338 cite0019 MO04 "This is about as far as a layman’s knowledge goes. The techniques that are then used for altering the burji remain known only to the specialists. Essentially, what the experts do is to utilize the links that the burji is believed to have with other phenomena. For instance it is held that a burji may be male ( lab ) or female ( dheddig ). Every burji is also connected with one or several of the seven skies ( todooba samadood ). It also has connections with the astral bodies, with the four elements and with different organs of the body. In brief, the notion of burji rests on the assumption of correspondences between various elements of the cosmos. Since I have already given attention to these aspects of the concept of burji (Chapter 4), I shall here repeat only the most central points: There is considerable discrepancy between the interpretations of burji given by different experts. The interpretations and the different calculations required are performed with the help of Arabic books and are regarded as a part of the “secret knowledge” called asraar or cilmi sireed . Depending on what books the expert has access to, the interpretation of a person’s burji will vary. It should also be noted that several of the symbols which appear in these consultations do not correspond to objects identified in other circumstances. The four elements, for instance, are not parts of Somali cosmology."
t0338 cite0019 MO04 "Another factor is the use of Arabic throughout the treatments, which confers a shroud of obscurity to the religious therapy."
t0338 cite0019 MO04 "The alteration of a person’s burji that one aims at establishing, is to some extent determined by the disease from which the patient suffers and in what part of the body it can be located (cf. note 1). In one case when a woman was suffering from pain in the chest, it was determined that it was her heart, the qalbi, that was causing the illness. The woman’s burji was calculated by an expert who also established a number for the star which bears [Page 113] the name qalbi . The number of the woman’s burji was added to that of the star and the sum reached was the number fifteen. He then drew a diagram of three by three squares and wrote an Arabic character in each square. The position numbers of these characters would add up to fifteen in each row of squares. On the same paper he then wrote the surah Yaasiin, which, as I have mentioned is the “heart” of the Qur’an. The paper was folded carefully and the woman subsequently had it put into a cover of leather, a xersi, to bear around her neck."
t0339 cite0019 MO04 "More importantly, the medicine itself derives its power from its links with categories that are opposed to the normal, mundane and known. Whether it is a matter of plants brought in from the wild, or of religious formulas informed by sacred knowledge, or of medicines manufactured by strangers, the efficacy of a treatment depends on the degree of such connections. A plant from a distant place is more powerful than one which grows close to the house-wall. A religious expert who possesses many holy books and can master an obscure religious idiom is more reliable than one who can recite only a few surahs. Similarly, the medicine brought from a distant country or distributed by a foreigner is preferable to that which is imported from Kenya or obtained from the local dispensary."
t0340 cite0020 MO04 "To recapitulate: a brief description has been given of the Cushitic world of power manifest in an apparently incoherent and rather vague hierarchy of refractions of the Sky God ( Waaq ). This world presided over by God comprises the phenomena which we call ‘natural’; the sun, moon, and stars, the winds, rainbow, rains, and the rest, as well as the more contiguous parts of nature, the hills, trees, and water, which make up man’s immediate surroundings. Certain configurations of these phenomena are fraught with power, available sometimes to ritual experts only, sometimes to whoever chances to cross their path. One of the tribal religious expert’s ( wadaad ) special skills is his knowledge [Page [p.28]] of the skies and power to interpret the movements of the heavenly bodies (Cerulli, 1929, 1931 (2))."
t0341 cite0021 FQ05 "The Bemba cannot be described as a fishing tribe. As a food, fish makes one of their favourite relishes, and is reckoned nearly as great as meat. They catch fish whenever they can, and very much appreciate dried fish, but such food is regarded rather as a sudden piece of luck than as a regular article of diet, and fishing itself in a greater part of the country is an amusing pursuit, particularly when undertaken communally, rather than a serious means of getting one’s livelihood. Among the neighbouring Bisa, a fishing tribe living on Lake Bangweolu, each fish is known by name and referred to as such, and every child in the community is able to pick out the different sorts correctly from a heap. But among the Bemba, though different types are recognized by the older men, the rest of the natives just speak of ‘fish’. The Bisa regularly dry fish and trade it over the country. They have a fixed system of prices and reckon each catch carefully in terms of financial profit. The Bemba, on the other hand, only sell fish occasionally, at certain seasons of the year, and then by a process of casual barter. Apart from those who live by the banks of big rivers they are indifferent boatmen and handle clumsily the paddles of the dug-out canoes at river fords. Along the Chambesi, Luansenshi, and other big rivers there are, however, definite fishing villages recognized by the natives as such. These villages remain fixed in one position year in year out. Here we find fishing by one method or another going on all the year round, a complex system of ownership of weirs and rights of use of ponds, and special fishing ceremonies such as are not found over the rest of the plateau. The inhabitants of these villages are definitely specialist fishermen, distinguished by name as umulonga (plur. abalonga ) and considered very exclusive and even dour by the rest of the Bemba. The latter discuss the habits of these fishermen as though they were almost a [Page 330] race apart, although in reality they differ from other Bemba merely in regard to their fixed habitation, greater degree of intermarriage, and independence of their neighbours. It will be best to sketch fishing methods in general as they are practised all over the country, and then to describe the more complex type of occupation characteristic of these riverine villages."
t0342 cite0022 FQ09 "In approaching Nyambe or his subordinates, skill and knowledge were important, for, as the myths of Kamunu suggested, they gave man what power he had in the face of a capricious god.

t0342 cite0022 FQ09 "Nyambe was capricious. He radiated darkness and light. The world and all that happened in it eventually depended upon him. His world was full of resources which were therefore charged with positive or negative potentials, reflecting his nature. Jacottet's informants explained this graphically: nothing in the natural environment was neutral (which is not the same as animism). 31 Skill and faith were both necessary to manipulate the natural environment beneficially. Take the crucial commodity of rain. In their argument, the rainmaker had told Livingstone that ‘God alone can make rain, my medicines don't make it. But he has given us the knowledge of certain plants and trees by which we pray to him to make rain for us. We charm the clouds and he makes the rain for us.’ 32 Jacottet's informants told him of the powers of the ‘old man of the rain and thunder’ 33 and of the way that the royal ancestors could be beseeched to intercede with Nyambe to bring rain. The relationship was the same even if the methods were different. 34"

t0342 cite0022 FQ09 "The professions of healer ( ñaka ) and of witch ( muloi ) were very similar in many of their ritual performances. Techniques of diagnosis and divination, of bewitching and of curing, were frequently similar, sometimes [Page 148] indistinguishable. Jalla was given the standard evasive answer in the 1890s: ‘According to the Lozi [sorcery] comes from the Mbunda, just like mwati ’ (vegetable poison, of which more below). The real distinction between witch and healer was one of motive expressed by certain ritual behaviour, and part of this sense was in Jalla's own observation that ‘the moloi (sorcerer) is someone who divines with evil intent [ jete des mauvais sorts ] -- the ngaka (doctors) are entirely different’"
t0343 cite0022 FQ09 "Liñaka (healers) who were appropriately skilled could provide protective medicines that would prevent bewitchment. Such medicines were, and are, highly prized. However, the danger was that the healer consulted might be a hidden witch and so the protective medicine might, in fact, capture the spirit of the seeker after protection."
t0344 cite0022 FQ09 "Consequently, ‘the most sought after doctors are foreigners. One goes to them, or has them brought at great expense’ 44 precisely because they would not involve the risk of local healers who might capture and use one's spirit."
t0344 cite0022 FQ09 "Manipulation of medicines enabled suitably skilled men to control the lesser creatures. A healer who had such medicines could control animals beneficially; the most important of such were crocodile doctors who could protect cattle from attack whilst fording a river. 46 A witch, whose motives were evil, would direct his familiars to evil actions. 47 Snake doctors and those with lion magic were especially feared."
t0344 cite0022 FQ09 "However, to beat the witches at their own game was too risky a course for commoners. So before one was bewitched it was generally better to employ a specialist healer with his protective medicines and when it was too late, to consult divination. Techniques of divination have changed more easily than other areas of ritual. For the 1880s and 1890s we can establish the range shown in Table 7, which I divide by general area of application and increasing seriousness of subject."
t0345 cite0023 FQ09 "Siyaya ( liyaya ), sisongo ( cisongo, kayongo ) and tundundu are all ailments caused by mahamba . The symptoms are headaches and swelling of parts of the body; sisongo affects the legs of the patient, siyaya and tundundu affect the chest or stomach. Divination shows the cause, and exorcism and skilled treatment by an ng'aka are required. These mahamba would appear to be true ancestral spirits for, according to informants, siyaya is known to have existed among the Lozi of Lewanika's reign in the early years of the century. Its acceptance by the luyana was such that Kuntz (1932.131) considered that it was a Lozi ailment. In Mankoya, on the other hand, Symon (1950, 72-73, 76-77) noted that liyaya appeared only to affect the immigrant Wiko ( lunda-luvale ) peoples of the district. He records that the exorcism is assisted, in cases of sisongo and liyaya , by medicine taken orally and by hot fomentations applied to the affected parts of the body. He does not, as does Kuntz, mention inhalations. Modern mahamba , such as, ‘ ndeke (aeroplane), which is derived by infection from areas where planes are frequently seen. This lihamba is said to cause weakness of the legs when walking (McCulloch, 1951.78), were also encountered during the investigation, and one of these, bindele , is fully discussed in Chapter VI."
t0346 cite0024 FE12 "Warnings that the witches are at work may also come from dreams. To dream of being persecuted by a cow, a wild animal, or a European, means that a witch is after you, and there is a little trick to find out if this is so: “It is said that the eyes of the witches look a bit different in colour, and that some can see from the back of their heels. Experts in detecting witches say that if you apply sand or some specially prepared black powder to the back of the heels of such persons, if they really are witches, their eyes will at once begin to glow”...

t0347 cite0025 FE12 "I saw the patient once more about a week later. (It was a very long walk to the “village”.) The patient was unchanged. An incident had, however, occurred which convinced everyone that the patient's mother was a witch. A bird—probably a night-jar—had flown into the room in which she and some other women were sleeping. It blundered against the lighted lantern several times before it made off. The other women were terrified. The bird could only have been another witch turned into a hawk and come to call its fellow-witch to the night's assembly. The practitioner then insisted on shaving the mother's head and performing [Page 366] the rest of a witch's purification ritual. He insisted that she should confess—which she reluctantly and resentfully did. I then left the district and only later heard the sequel. The mother became more and more irritated by the medicine-man's nagging till one day she seized a stick and beat the patient. The medicine-man then said he would have no murderous assaults in his village so he expelled both the patient and his mother. Some labourers carried the patient in a litter to the main road where he and his mother were put on a lorry and not heard of again."
t0348 cite0026 FE12 "When an Ashanti falls ill, and the sickness does not yield to the ordinary household remedies (really household magic), or cannot be diagnosed, it then becomes necessary to call in a doctor. The doctor, as we have already seen, may be either what we should call a general practitioner, or a specialist. The Ashanti word for the former is Sumanni (pl. Sumankwafo), or sometimes Oduruyefo, and for the latter Bonsam 'Komfo. The exact derivation of these terms is interesting. Sumanni is just one who deals in suman, i. e. charms. If we studied his methods superficially, we should say he was a herbalist, and so he is, in so far as he works with leaves and roots and plants; but there is this great difference—his medicines are not efficacious because of their antitoxic properties, but because of their magic properties. The disease, for which he sets out to prescribe, is itself caused by superhuman agencies, and can only be cured by similar counter-measures. [Page 148] It is spirit acting upon spirit, not antitoxin upon toxin. There are many allied diseases in the spiritual pharmacopoeia, with all of which the sumankwafo are capable of dealing. There is one, however, which he cannot treat, the most dreaded scourge in Africa, a malady which I suppose it is no exaggeration to state has taken toll of tens of thousands of lives—i.e. witchcraft. Against this disease the Ashanti calls in the specialist, the Bonsam 'Komfo. Now okomfo is really a priest, one upon whom akom (possession) may come, and Bonsam is a male witch. I have already dealt with the craft of witch-doctors, or white witches, or whatever we may decide to call them, and we have seen how an analysis of their title explains the source of their inspirations, for these are men who have learned to use and control black magic in order to defeat black magic."
t0348 cite0026 FE12 "As a general rule their methods of treatment are indirect, for they strive to cure the patient by stamping out the cause of the disease at its source, i. e. the discovery and exposure and killing of the witch. This quest, as we shall see presently, does not end with the death of the doctors' patient, for this ‘priest of the powers of evil’ will even call the spirit of the dead man, whom he has been unable to cure, to help him in his search for the murderer."
t0349 cite0027 FA16 "Besides these human-borne threats, the Dogon know their illnesses and environmental risks; however, these are not personalized. The treatment of illnesses is clearly differentiated from the protection against evil. Illnesses can be treated—evil cannot. The specialist in illness treatment, jòjòngunu, usually is not considered a dudugonu [sorcerer], though some suspicions may surface. General risks, such as drought, plague, or war, are not considered an evil from outside but are things with which the capricious supernatural world plagues its underlings."
t0350 cite0027 FA16 "Despite these obvious differences, some resemblances between the two societies' “rites of Monday” can be discerned. The individual is portrayed as a vulnerable being who is an obvious prey for the (supernatural) predators at large in the more or less direct environment. Still, that same individual has his or her defenses and can rely on outsiders; many of these private rituals do involve asking for professional assistance, an aspect notably absent in the great community rituals. In our examples, a diviner/blacksmith (Kapsiki) and a general ritual specialist (Dogon) are consulted. Individual rites also often call for divination, a professional service only a few qualified people can offer (Plate 11-8). The rites performed may be simple, but often are not, and in any case their application calls for specialized and secret knowledge. Even if the rites are simple, it may be much safer to have a specialist perform them."
t0351 cite0027 FA16 "Thus, the moves to establish oneself as an individual and the processes involved in maintaining the boundary between ego and community reinforce the social ties of the individual, making him or her more dependent on others. These social relationships are not to the same persons the individual seeks protection for or against (kith and kin or outsiders); on the other hand, the specialists are the same that may help threaten the individual supernaturally. A specialist in protection is also a specialist in aggression. To guard oneself, one must deliver part of the independence to those people who may be most dangerous to one's very existence."
t0352 cite0028 FA16 "Indeed, if divination is practiced by a skilled professional whose services are remunerated, every individual may on his own account interpret the “wondrous speech” (s`[unavailable]: tà:nie) of nature. The symbolic messages of “speech of the world” are not only valid for a static interpretation of universal categories, but they also assume a dynamic importance by standing as individual warnings that have a general bearing on the immediate future. The elements of interpretation are not the same in both cases because symbolic correspondences and mythological considerations of the species also come into play. For omens it is the particular event that is significant. For example, because the turtledove likes the perch on the Acacia albida tree and sings a song reminiscent of “sígi language” it is symbolically associated with the Fox and with death; but the song of a single turtledove in the bush would mean “return to the village, [Page 526] strangers have come” or “proceed calmly with your work,” according to the bird's position, whether between the person and the village or in the other direction toward the bush."
t0353 cite0028 FA16 "Being sensitive to music, however, does not necessarily mean that one is able to produce it himself. Ambara is in fact a very typical example. A supreme expert in all rhythms and a remarkable dancer who is able to cite the lyrics to almost any song, he is not capable of singing in his own right and is a mediocre drummer. It is not, he explains, that he has no oil [musical ability]. On the contrary, he has a great deal, but it does not come out and water comes in its place, that is to say, his song is mere “speech.” The oil comes as far as his throat and drops down, pushed by the uvula which, according to Ambara, “decides that person's work is not to sing, that he has other things to do.” This means that he should not engage in singing or playing an instrument if he has no talent."

Apart from the dyeing procedures, decoration is done with yellow or red earths (ocher); black motifs on wood are obtained by branding."
t0355 cite0030 MS12 "Even in cases where the sufferer’s own misdemeanour is responsible for the illness it usually takes a cult specialist to analyse the details and call attention to the probable circumstances in which the insult occurred. The diagnostic technique used is first to consider the nature of the illness and match it with those associated with specific spirits. Once the probable identity of the afflicting spirit is known the diagnosis proceeds to an examination of the circumstances in which the spirit could have been angered. With the diagnosis complete a boka (native doctor) who usually also has a cult status will first prescribe the sacrifice of an animal identified with the spirit. If this does not result in an elimination of the symptoms a curing rite (initiation) at the hands of the bori cult may be prescribed. During initiation the patient is treated with medicines symbolically identified with the spirit or spirits believed to have caused the illness. For example, if the illness has been caused by Danko (a snake spirit) the treatment will include the drinking of an infusion made from kanya (African ebony; Diospyros mespiliformis ) wood and kanwa (potash), the former being sacred to Danko."
t0355 cite0030 MS12 "As mentioned above, once a person has been marked by the spirits as a desired ‘mount’ he is initiated into the cult under the direction of the formerly afflicted. His initiation or ‘cure’ marks a transition from one achieved status to another; he becomes a minor ‘doctor’ and is qualified to treat others with similar afflictions. It is through affliction therefore that a person may earn cult status and gradually achieve religious acclaim even if his status among the non-afflicted remains unchanged and low."
t0356 cite0030 MS12 "At the broadest level, horses of the gods recognize possession-trance which is either na gaskiya (lit. of truth; authentic) or na karya (lit. of lie; fraudulent). They do not doubt the sincerity of bori na karya which may occur within their ranks; it is usually classed as total ineptitude, a problem for the divine horseman but not the cult. This attitude is further expressed in what might be called the ‘cancellation rules’ for a possession-trance event. It is not possible for an event to be ‘broken’ with fraudulent trance even if it is a subject for discussion by the participants and generally detracts from the excitement of the performance. Within the class of bori na gaskiya performances by individuals, there are those which are less spectacular in the demonstration of possession-trance than others; these are commonly by the newly initiated. Since possession-trance behaviour is recognized as learned and constitutes a skill, the inexperienced are not expected to be as proficient as devotees with a long history of cult involvement. The single, most important characteristic which native critics use to distinguish ‘true’ possession-trance from false is body temperature. They state that a person in true dissociation state perspires heavily, and his body should be hot to the touch. Lee also notes that sweat is the most important symbol of dissociation in Bushman possession-trance (1968: 44). For them perspiration is the visible expression of powerful medicines on the surface of the body, for the Hausa it is the visible expression of a spirit’s presence ‘on the neck’ of a devotee."
t0357 cite0030 MS12 "Chronic illnesses require a more drastic course of treatment than a single remedy or sacrifice and a diagnostician customarily prescribes an elaborate curing ritual which, as already indicated, is actually an initiation ritual. Whereas such rituals organized by a senior cult-adept emphasize the attainment of a new status, those organized by a musician focus only on curing the sufferer. Consistent with a musician’s avoidance of any demonstration of possession-trance, such skills are not encouraged in the neophyte. Musician-diagnosticians operate on the assumption that to invoke the afflicting spirits (at which they are particularly proficient) and beg their assistance in making the sufferer well-offering in exchange recognition of their power and a promise to provide them with regular sacrifices-is sufficient to achieve a ‘cure’. In such cases it is thought the spirits will remain dormant on the heads of the neophytes and thus no active trancing will be necessary. Such cures-the only ones musician-diagnosticians are able to provide-are regarded as incomplete or worse by practising cult-adepts, but because the sufferer and his relatives believe they can ‘work’ they are a popular alternative to total cult involvement."

Quranic verses are bound in decorative leather cases and worn on a necklace as a protective charm (LAYA). Sickness and death are believed to be the result of someone's or some spirit's (JINN) evil intentions. One cure, called ALO, involves the MALAM writing a Quranic verse on a wooden board, washing the ink off into a vessel and then having the patient drink it. Besides the MALAM, there are secular specialists who deal with physical ailments such as muscular pains, swellings and broken bones. Kanuri also will seek the advice and treatment of Western- trained doctors."

t0360 cite0033 FF57 "Ed.: “Although the prevailing conception of the akombo is that of evil forces, each liable to cause some specific form of ailment or misfortune, it must not be thought that all ills which come upon mankind are believed to be due to supernatural causes. The Tiv recognize three possibilities or stages in every adverse event. The first thing is that the thing may have happened in a quite natural way. If a man meets with an accident, of falls sick of some common disease of which the symptoms are obvious, he does not necessarily at first suspect supernatural interference, and treats his wound or ailment without recourse to magic of any kind. But just as it is natural for animals to be healthy and for trees to bear fruit, so it is natural for the sickness to run its course and the sore to heal up. If it does not do so, then it is time to suspect other agencies at work, and recourse is had to divination to discover which particular akombo is interfering with the normal course of nature. If the symptoms are obvious it is not always necessary, of course, to go to the diviner. If you have a cough, or pains in the stomach, which do not yield to normal treatment, any knowledgeable elder can tell you from the symptoms of the complaint which akombo is the cause. You then go to some one who is master of that particular akombo, who gives you the medicine which belongs to it, and for this you pay a nominal fee ( t[unknown]ndo ataa ). You do not need to go through the full ceremony of ‘setting it right’ (magically), unless the medicine play an equal part. Finally, if all rites have been performed and there is still no sign of improvement, the cause must 183 be witchcraft. The guilty party is discovered by divination, and steps are taken against him as described below (p. 326). If action is not taken then, the man may die, but he cannot be killed by the akombo alone.”"
t0361 cite0034 FF57 "“In its present form--but it changes continually as it spreads--the movement comprises two grades of initiate, which may be described as “practitioner” and “disciple”. The former has paid a high price for the secrets of the cult and the right to initiate others; the latter has purchased for a small fee (but this has lately risen from 4d to 6d in certain areas) immunity [Page -181-] from witchcraft, the ability to discern witches and freedom from all rules other than those prescribed by the practitioner."

Thereafter some go to sleep in neighbouring compounds while others learn the Nyambuan song, the burden of which is ‘Down with Jebu ’ ( Jebu , from ‘counterfeit’, is the Nyambuan jargon for witch or witchcraft). Next morning candidates bathe ceremonially at a neighbouring pool and are then initiated with a ritual analogous to confirmation or baptism, the climax of which consisted of the drinking of a special potion. The whisks and wands are blessed and returned to them and they are told that the former will enable them to smell out any witches that come near them and to follow their trail, despite changes of shape. An estatic running round a course marked out with carved posts or trees follows, and initiation is complete. All other charms and medicines are surrendered and renounced before the ceremony begins."
t0361 cite0034 FF57 "“The practitioner also provides special medicines for all bodily and spiritual ills and sometimes practices divination and simple ‘magic’ for the entertainment of his clients. Most of the potions appear to be relatively harmless to normal persons, the main ingredients being red pepper, sorrel and various bitter [Page -182-] barks and roots; some deaths have been ascribed to drinking Nyambuan, however, and several cases of mental breakdown. The exact connexion is extremely difficult to prove in a court of law, and up to date no conviction has been obtained on charges of poisoning or possessing dangerous drugs."
t0362 cite0035 FF57 "The leopard’s whiskers are used in certain magical ways for the ceremonial casting of spells. If a leopard is killed it must not be touched until a practitioner of the supreme ‘akombo i biam’ has removed the whiskers; this practitioner also cuts up the body and he himself, or with the elders, eats the heart. The slayer also must go through certain rites of purification. The whole of the Tiv tribe chip the teeth in imitation of the leopard. Some of the Tiv clans say definitely ‘Anyam due se’ (the leopard brought us forth.)"
t0363 cite0036 FF57 "Tsav is a Tiv word, whose meanings can range from, at widest, knowledge or wisdom, to witchcraft and the witchcraft substance, supposedly found in the chest. It is possible that tsav has undergone a gradual narrowing down in meaning: at any rate, if you ask a Tiv, “Do you know tsav? ” the anwer will be an emphatic denial, since the primary reference is to witchcraft, although in discussing the meaning of the word, the sense of ability or talent will be recognized. When one asks about “good tsav, ” one may be told that all tsav is bad; alternatively, the ability to know mystically about people who are using witchcraft may be described as good tsav . “Tiv specialists” of the colonial administration seem to have regarded tsav as a morally neutral mystical power attributed to the elders and providing them with authority in the eyes of the people, akin in its nature to the mana reported from peoples of the Pacific. My own interpretation would be that tsav always has a vaguely sinister set of connotations, even though the Tiv distinguish between the group use of tsav by senior men in a way which is to some degree regulated and its reckless use by individuals motivated by mere envy; it is true that tsav has political aspects, but this serves more to indicate Tiv suspiciousness towards all forms of power than to prove the innocence of tsav . 27"
t0363 cite0036 FF57 "Tiv tend to state that either there is no good tsav, or else that the capacity to see other people’s tsav is good tsav . In particular situations, however, the use of tsav may be approved or held permissible."
t0364 cite0037 FF57 "In practice, Tiv bother more about misfortune caused to important men by the envy of their relatives, than good fortune coming to them from the moral backing of their relatives; thus, I heard this comment on the illness of a prominent magicomedical practitioner, who had just received the promise of a primary school for his compound: “His agnates are saying that he has too much, he has a market, a dispensary, and now he has a school.” However, the occurrence of good fortune is felt to need some form of explanation, and this is found in the belief in the [Page 96] journey of certain elders to Mount Swem."
t0365 cite0038 AA01 "Another specialist with the supernatural, known as pangsa , lives in the second ku . She is a blind middle-aged woman who chants a meaningless set of syllables that superficially resembles a Buddhist sutra. She emphasizes the tempo of the chant on a drum. She attempts to ward off lust and disease. She is not considered as skilled as the pangsa living in other villages."
t0365 cite0038 AA01 "Though many men in the village were sceptical of the reputed abilities of the chom-jengi , saju-jengi , and pangsa , they tolerated members of their own families who consulted them. One male informant referred to shamanism as superstitious nonsense, and objected particularly to the dancing and the use of the drum. He pointed out, that it was considered illegal behavior by governmental authorities and that the Japanese tried to discourage it. He believed that a Buddhist priest is more capable of placating an angry or evil spirit. He estimated that twenty per cent of illness in the village was due to evil spirits. Others occurred because of physiological difficulties."
t0366 cite0038 AA01 "Blind male pongsa , derived from poksa (diviner), constitute a widely known occupational group already known during the Koryo dynasty (935-1392 A.D.). The Koryo period with its predilection for fortune tellers is well known to Korean scholars and classic geomancers. Pongsa would also pray for rain, or could bring about a curse. They were thought potent because Koreans often believe that the blind have another kind of sight, “eye sight of mind.” They frequently shave their heads like Buddhist priests and recite meaningless sutra-like passages. It is likely that these blind specialists have been influenced by the Tantric sect of Buddhism."
t0367 cite0038 AA01 "Among those individuals who deal with religious and ethical matters, the skilled pungsu or chigwon is accorded the most prestige. The pungsu , invariably a man, receives [Page 150] the social recognition extended to a distinguished scholar. He is believed to have profound insight into the universal bi-polarity of nature, i.e., Yin and Yang . Though he is considered an authority on Confucianism, his particular area of specialization is the interpretation of the cosmological text previously mentioned as Choo Yok (Book of Changes). 18 Even the lowly fortune tellers, to enhance their predictions, pretend to have rudimentary knowledge of the same text. The last professional pungsu visited Sam Jong Dong in April of this same year to do “field work” and to see a friend. The friend, a long-time resident of the village, often is consulted as a pungsu by those who cannot afford the services of a professional from elsewhere. A pungsu is well-informed concerning classical geography. He is said to understand pang or air (wind) and su or water (streams and springs). He is [Page 151] considered to be the authority who can best determine grave sites and building locations, also the best day for marriage. According to complex Chinese metaphysics, he assigns a positive or negative value to every feature of the universe, e.g., a mountain ridge is positive and a river negative. Geomancy is done with human anatomical terms. Since a suitable grave site for a deceased is thought to permit the living members of the family to prosper, the advice of the pungsu receives serious attention. He often uses a compass with Chinese characters designating the directions which are associated with the five basic elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water). Even for burials in the common village cemetery, the pungsu's advice is sought for the proper orientation of the body. 19 Since all things are reducible to the five elements, the birthday of the deceased is related to a direction for the determination of a suitable corpse orientation. Only thirty per cent of the villagers can afford a professional pungsu . Usually the villager who is a friend and lay associate of a professional is the amateur pungsu consulted. If eldest son suffers from misfortune, it is often believed that this is due to the poor location of his father's grave. In such an instance, another pungsu is called in who may recommend that the body be exhumed, examined and transferred to a new grave."
t0368 cite0039 AA01 "Traditionally, the cause of illness was often thought to be evil forces. Modern scientific theories of pathogenesis appear not to have been readily accepted by the aged. According to one informant who observed the circumstances he describes, until the early 1960s some elderly people who had suffered misfortunes such as illness among their children prayed and made offerings to supernatural beings. The same informant, who had served as an intelligence officer on a farm, was once told that a sterile woman had secretly gone into the mountains and prayed to the “mountain god” for a child. Under Communist rule such magico-religious practices of medicine [Page 111] now appear to have been almost wiped out. The presence of specialists in modern medicine on each farm has brought to everyone modern medical knowledge, which, together with the activities of the campaign against supernaturalism, has seriously weakened if not entirely obliterated the traditional beliefs. [*AL note: This was preceded by a section about an anti-religious campaign led by younger generations to obliterate old professions of traditional religious practitioners, including among their families. Appears to result from anti-religious sentiment due to communism.]"
t0369 cite0040 AD05 "Shamans of various kinds are still consulted for illnesses although villagers believe the frequency is declining. Three different men, all from nearby villages, are called in periodically. However, trips are also made to the consulting rooms of two others, a ching tsao hsien [Page 389] (master of green grass) in Hsin Tien and a mi fang hsien (master of secret remedies) in Taipei. Shamans usually appear to be consulted with reference to illnesses which are psychosomatic in nature or those which are relatively hopeless, i.e., medical advice has not worked. This latter may be merely because sufficient time for medical treatment to take effect has not elapsed. If someone is sick, many kinds of practitioners may be consulted quickly, both medical and religious. Serious illness in children, male and female alike, stimulates the call for a shaman quicker than would identical symptoms in adults. Shamans are rarely used for old people (beyond age 60) who have not been vigorous recently because after 60, death is considered inevitable and any years granted beyond 60 were only due to the favor of the gods. With a terminal illness, the family patiently waits for death without treatment..."
t0369 cite0040 AD05 "Two part-time hung tou (red-headed Taoist priests) from Hsin Tien participate at many big ceremonies in the village and li . Finally, one particular part-time shaman, a fa shih and his assistant from over the mountain were frequently hired for certain ceremonies. Perhaps the term hired is too strong for no fee was ever discussed when an invitation was extended but the fa shih always received a sizable gift for officiating, the equivalent of a week's pay for an experienced farm laborer, plus elaborate food. This man has the ability to inspire others to go into trances and then he can interpret what they say if they “speak in tongues” or read the “spirit characters” a man in a trance may write in sand which is spread in a fine layer on a table."
t0370 cite0041 AD05 "The belief that a fright does damage to the soul is widespread. If small children and infants are observed to be crying far more than is usual, it is assumed that they have suffered a fright and they can be relieved of it only by ceremonial means. One such ceremony, used after other means to pacify the child have failed, consists of covering a bowl of rice with one of the child's garments and rubbing the covered [Page 105] bowl over the child's hands and feet. Then, the person conducting the ceremony (who can be anyone with expertise -- when I observed it, the child's grandmother and one of her friends performed the ceremony) fills his mouth with wine and sprays it over the child's extremities and stomach. Paper money to the gods is burned as the conclusion to the ceremony. Ideally, this should be done immediately after the child has been “frightened,” but it is difficult to tell whether it is necessary until a few days have passed."
t0371 cite0042 AD05 "In religious thought the relation of the gods to the natural world they inhabit and control is equated with political and judicial life. Heaven and earth in this sense are known as hu , “courts,” or “prefectures.” The sun, moon, five planets, and five dippers are the positions (not necessarily identified with observable heavenly bodies) of the hu of heaven. They have earthly counterparts, such as the five sacred mountains. Knowledge of their names is left to the experts, diviners and priests, who act as lawyers and bureaucrats issuing petitions and passes and advising and guiding the client through the sacred protocol and squeeze."
t0372 cite0043 AD05 "Nowadays when illness strikes, the villagers observe its symptoms and try to determine its nature. From experience with certain basic sets of symptoms, illnesses are distinguished as being either in the realm of the physiological or supernatural, and therefore requiring a cure within that particular realm. Thanks to the villagers' new awareness of the germ theory of disease, most illnesses are immediately classified as physiological and, therefore, within the domain of science and medicine -- primarily modern, Western-style medicine rather than Chinese herbal medicine. Such illnesses as measles, rashes and skin diseases, trachoma, colds, stomach disorders supposedly resulting from bad food or water, and the like, all fall clearly into this category. To treat these illnesses, it is now customary for the villagers either to call in a Western-style practitioner or to choose their own drugs or patent medicines."
t0373 cite0043 AD05 "It is a commonplace among villagers that “No medicine can help if a person runs into something evil,” for example, one of the demons known as kuei or mo shen . Consequently, when the practitioner of Western medicine is unsuccessful in curing an ailment, the illness is [Page 258] clearly of supernatural origin and must be attacked by someone versed in supernatural methods -- the shaman."
t0374 cite0043 AD05 "There is no particular problem with illnesses which can be clearly diagnosed as natural or supernatural. But there are many cases in which the diagnosis is not so easy or clear-cut. Mainly, the villagers rely on past experience to tell them which set of symptoms indicates which category of illness, and thus which kind of practitioner to call in. Naturally, there are considerable variations among the villagers themselves which may predispose a decision in one direction or the other -- level of education, amount of experience, financial ability, and even types of social pressure. As one would expect, the actual availability of drugs and doctors affects choice. In recent years the dependence upon Western medicines and Western-oriented doctors has increased as a result of the increased supply of both at relatively low cost. The ease of access to antibiotics and patent medicines, their effectiveness, and the doctors' record of successes have given confidence in Western science, with the result that it is common today for the villagers to turn to Western methods first for most illnesses."
t0374 cite0043 AD05 "Many villagers now also feel that it is simpler to call in a Western-style doctor. A shaman often requires the assistance of two or three other people who must be asked in to help in the ritual, at their convenience. Further, when the Western doctor is called in, he charges a fee, and with its payment the transaction is completed. There is no residual feeling of obligation which must be discharged. The shaman, if he is a local one, usually charges nothing at all for his services, and often it is more comfortable not to incur such a feeling of obligation. Then, there are a number of incidental expenses connected with his visit -- the cost of sacrifices and the food for all the participants and observers at the ritual."
t0374 cite0043 AD05 "Having two types of medical practice at one's disposal is not always an unmixed blessing, however, since the decision that an illness is natural or supernatural may be, or may be held to be, influenced by external circumstances. A case in point is the following which happened to a very poor family in Hsin Hsing. The parents were no longer young and already had three daughters and a small son when another daughter was born. Before the infant was named (naming takes place on the ninth day and is, in effect, when an infant becomes human) she became quite ill. Instead of calling in a practitioner of Western medicine, which many villagers insisted they would have done first, the family chose to consider the illness supernatural because the baby was not yet nine-days-old. They called in one shaman, and then another. Despite their efforts, the infant died. Under the traditional ideas the death was attributable to the will of the gods, and the family had done all it could do. The villagers gossiped busily about [Page 259] the event, however, noting that the family was poor and had too many girls already; implicit in their gossip was a recognition that the family may have preferred to have the female infant die."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "(Time and site, social and financial problems). The choices of a good time and a good site for building a factory or storeroom or for digging a well are seen by local people as crucial in preventing disease and the other misfortunes that would result from the offense, fright, or disturbance of geomantic forces, or of harmony ensuing from a bad choice. Patients also present social or mental problems: quarrelling, alcoholism, insomnia, anxiety, disobedient wives or children, a spate of traffic accidents, or flunked examinations. The diagnoses can often be linked to fate, offense, or the actions of ghosts. Lastly, people come in with a host of completely non-medical problems involving business, inheritance, or planning for the future. As there are no secular practitioners to help people sort out these problems, they come to Ong-ia-kong ."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "Prominent in any of Ong-ia-kong's treatments is the hû-á , a magic character which appears in many variants throughout the spread and history of Chinese religion. In this cult, the efficacious hû-á is scribbled with a brush by the tang-ki while in trance. A neater version is also written by the assistant with a felt-tip pen on the back of some of the papers given to the patient. The scribbled hû-á may be pasted on the wall, worn, or put inside or placed upon a car or motorcycle. It may be burned and added to an herbal brew for drinking or external application. It may be burned with incense and spirit money to propitiate an offended supernatural. There is almost no treatment that doesn't involve at least one hû-á . Most of the cases that have anything to do with health also include a list of herbs for brewing and drinking. Herbs, hû-á, and dietary proscriptions are most common for “disease caused from body.”"
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "Treatments for ailments with supernatural causes generally include one or more of the following procedures:"
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "(1) Instructions on propitiating the malevolent deity in cases of chhiong-hoan ."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "(2) Exorcism of an area -- a room, a place outside the house, the child's blankets."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "(3) Referral to the market town temple for a regular ceremony performed there by Taoist priests -- these include star ritual ( chè-chhi n* ), patching of fate ( pó . - un * ), and crossing a gate."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "(4) Recommending a relationship which resembles godparenthood without, of course, the Christian implications. When a human godparent is chosen, this relationship is called “dry, mother” and “dry child.” When a god is chosen, the child becomes a “contract child” ( khè-kiá n* ) or “contract grandchild” ( khè-sun * ) of the god."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "(5) Recommending the making of a “soul basket” to cover the soul of the child. This is called khàm-hûn * “cover soul.” The child's name and birth time are written on red paper which is wrapped around some scraps of his hair and fingernails. This package is placed inside a small basket, covered with a cup, and hung from the beam of the family's ancestor hall. The ones I saw were made because of fright or “hard to raise” and were sometimes made in connection with the child's becoming a godchild..."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "In this section we return to the comments made in the introduction that (1) Ong-ia-kong is concerned with a different area of medicine than is Western medicine, and (2) the kind of treatment offered is very different. In reference to the first, three related conceptual matters must be taken up: (a) The perceived difference between Chinese and Western medicine; (b) the concept of patching; and (c) the concept of harmony ( pêng-an * )."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "(a) In a survey of 300 households, I asked the question, “How would you compare Chinese and Western medicine?” This is a sample of the responses received:"
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "Chinese medicine is slow, Western medicine is fast ."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "Western medicine hurts the stomach; Chinese medicine is gentle ."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "Whichever works is better ."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "Each has its advantages and disadvantages ."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "Chinese medicine is better for women's troubles and broken bones; Western medicine is better for acute disease ."
t0375 cite0044 AD05 "All these responses I heard many times. But by far the most common was: CHINESE MEDICINE CURES THE CAUSE; WESTERN MEDICINE [Page 129] CURES THE SYMPTOMS. * To “cure the symptoms” means to relieve symptomatic distress. To “cure the cause” means to treat the causative agent and also to remedy the situation that allowed disease to develop or infiltrate. To discuss “curing the cause,” one must discuss “patching” and harmony."
t0376 cite0044 AD05 "The initial symptoms are usually taken to a Western-style doctor . If the Western medical treatment is sufficient, the patient is satisfied. But in the course of a disease or several disease episodes, the patient may feel the Western medicine is insufficient and go to other methods of treatment, perhaps including a visit to Ong-ia-kong . The following examples illustrate this point:"
t0376 cite0044 AD05 "One child had frequent colds, fevers, and swollen glands. He was taken for treatment to a Western doctor; but, as the illness kept recurring, both the problem of patching and the problem of harmony became relevant. The mother patched the child's health with ginseng cooked with pigeon. And she heard from a fortune teller that his problems were caused by his father's brother, who had died without issue and wanted this child as his son. The dead man could only get this message across by disturbing the harmony of the family -- then they would seek out a practitioner who would make contact with the other world. A contract was drawn up for the child's adoption. * The child's health improved."
t0377 cite0045 AD05 "Time and place have special significance. Getting married on the wrong day or building a grave in the wrong place may have dire consequences. The almanac, which is found in almost every house, provides a general guide for choosing days, but is usually interpreted by a specialist. In addition, fortune tellers, priests, and gods (who communicate through divination or possession) may be consulted. Sites are more often chosen with the help of geomancers or older people who have mastered the important variables. But occasionally a time and often a place are selected without prior consultation. Row houses, for instance, are now located with regard to the street and neighbors. Thus when illness or misfortune occurs, the blame is often placed on incorrect choice of time or place. A place error usually can be corrected by relocation."
t0378 cite0045 AD05 "The second special ritual, Ch'i-sha , is to “lift” or drive away the bad atmosphere caused by malevolent deities. There is no piece of earth without its spirits (T'u-sha). Therefore any disturbance of the earth may [Page 100] disturb them and they in turn may cause illness, bad luck, or any of the other imaginable evils. Illness in young children is often ascribed to these spirits, as young children are particularly susceptible to malign influences. Construction, digging, repair, and burning are all possible sources of the relevant disturbance; when a child falls ill, it is often easy to find some such activity in the vicinity of the child's house. This ritual can be done after illness occurs, or ahead of time, when there is some earth disturbance. It may have to be carried out at the place where the earth was disturbed, but the professional practitioner can provide the diagnosis of the trouble -- cause of illness, location of disturbance, type of disturbance -- and the paraphernalia and directions for driving away the bad atmosphere. Usually ritual and/or herbal care is given to the child as well."
t0379 cite0046 AD05 "When her mother-in-law died, she said, her family had been too poor to afford the expensive merit ritual, but they soon suspected trouble when her father's sister, married into a [Page 111] wealthy family, became ill. After asking a very powerful god, she found out that there was trouble in her natal family, so she told them she would pay for a kong-tik for her sister-in-law. The ceremonies were duly performed, and not long afterward Ong-iong's mother went to a khan-bong (soul calling) specialist to talk to her mother-in-law. The spirit was crying, she said, but told her visitor that she had been much more comfortable in the spirit world since the kong-tik had been performed for her. Consequently, Ong-iong's mother was sure the rituals were effective. This was, of course, an empirical observation, but of the sort given little credence by most Taiwanese. Many fellow villagers have gone to khan-bong specialists themselves, and probably most had heard the old lady's story. But it takes a certain kind of credulous person to accept such evidence, and Ong-iong's mother was just that: a true believer..."
t0379 cite0046 AD05 "One person who justified her belief in terms of experience, but who still expressed belief in nearly all tenets of the folk religion, was Ong A-mui, a 64 year-old daughter-in-law of Ploughshare's only former landlord, and one of the few village women over 40 with any formal education or knowledge of the Mandarin Chinese language. Asked about appeals to gods, she cited an example from her own experience. Once when she was ill, she sought advice from a lay practitioner at the Pai-chi temple, who gave her a simple remedy to take three days running. She recovered, and this was evidence to her that appeals to gods can be effective. She added that gods are useful for purely diagnostic purposes -- by using divining blocks, one can tell if an illness is self-limiting or needs medical attention. She was sure that the principles of day selection worked for both wedding and funerals, and then volunteered that what is definitely true is that someone who mistakenly watches a funeral when prohibited from doing so because of disharmonious characters will suffer adverse affects. She would not necessarily believe this without personal experience, she said, but she had a sister-in-law who became violently ill upon watching a coffin carried out of a house, and had to be cured by priests summoned from San-hsia. Again she based her belief in personal experience."
t0380 cite0047 AD05 "The concept of “soul” ( ling-hun ) 1 is central to the study of Chinese folk religion for at least three reasons. (By “folk religion” I mean the religious beliefs and practices of the peasantry and other non-elite classes in late traditional China and in modern Chinese society outside the People's Republic. This term specifically excludes the textual religions (the State Cult, Buddhism, and Taoism) and also the beliefs and practices of religious specialists.)"
t0380 cite0047 AD05 "First, the idea of ling-hun underlies most notions of supernatural beings. As Wolf and Jordan have demonstrated for Taiwan, and as evidence from other parts of China also suggests, the great majority of supernatural beings propitiated by believers in Chinese folk religion are thought to originate from the “souls” of dead people. 3 “Gods,” or shen , are the “souls” of especially powerful or meritorious people; 4 ancestors, or tsu-hsien , are “souls” of one's own agnatic forebears; and ghosts, or kuei , are “souls” of those who died violent deaths or who have no descendants to worship them as ancestors. Second, the loss of one's “soul” is an extremely common explanation for many kinds of diseases and aberrations, both mental and physical, that are analyzed and treated by Chinese “sacred medicine.” 5 Many cures concentrate on getting the “soul” back. 6 Third, trance -- a state common to folk practitioners in many parts of southern China -- is invariably explained in terms of “soul” travel or spirit possession."
t0381 cite0047 AD05 "Adults can also suffer from involuntary “soul” loss, but in their case it is much more serious. Many things may be responsible for adult “soul” loss: attack by any of [Page 525] several kinds of supernatural beings, particularly malevolent ones, such as vengeance-seeking ghosts; 32 sorcery, performed by an evil specialist in writing magic paper charms which work on the victim by contagious magic; taking fright; or possibly a combination of one of these and a person's particular susceptibility in a given year. But the symptoms always seem to be those of what we would call severe mental illness. The one serious case I knew of involved a fifteen-year-old girl who did not return home from work one night and behaved strangely the next day and for several months afterwards. She was likely, especially in the afternoons, to go into screaming fits, at first wailing coherent phrases, like a mourner at a funeral, then falling into coarse groans and grunts. She would not respond to any of her relatives or friends when they tried to consold her or calm her down, nor would she, when she was in this state of mind, accept anything to eat or drink. Everyone in the rural community where the girl lived agreed that her ling-hun was gone; in fact, this diagnosis was confirmed by a succession of experts called in to try to cure her. Diagnoses of the causes of her condition varied from sorcery to a haunted house to a jealous great-grandfather angered over his lack of patrilineal descendants, but all agreed that wherever the malevolence came from, her ling-hun had been taken away. The “soul” was called, offerings were made to possible “soul”-thieves, and a sequence of charm-writers was tried before the girl finally seemed to calm down and resume more or less normal behavior. Like the children who lose their “souls” temporarily, this adult was exhibiting strange behavior patterns which the villagers could not trace to any obvious physical or social stimulus; only the loss of ling-hun could explain the girl's affiction."
t0382 cite0048 AD05 "The above song contrasts the pig's usefulness and willingness to help out with other domestic animals' usefulness and willingness to help out. The pig is obviously deficient in both areas: his work is minor and self-gratifying, and his lackadaisical attitude about dying shows that he is not ardent in the service of his owner. Indeed, pigs are even seen as faintly malevolent. One family, for example, was told by a ritual expert that their present difficulties stemmed from the fact that a pigsty had once existed underneath their kitchen. Unless they unearthed all the stones that the pigs had lived on, their difficulties would continue."
t0383 cite0049 AD05 "Although only the tang-ki was able to give me such a detailed analysis, almost everyone knew something about correspondences between the body and its house and tree, most commonly those [Page 239] linking the roof to the head, a woman's flowers to her children, and the roots to the feet. There is some individual variation in how other parts of the body are said to correspond to parts of the tree or house. This leaves room for the person with a dirty well, say, to assume that the well stands for whichever internal organ is causing him discomfort. At the least it is clear that a great many villagers engage in speculation about the relation of the body to its tree and house; it is not an esoteric matter restricted to ritual experts."
t0384 cite0050 RV02 "Shamans hone their skills through their helper spirits in a mutual courtship more subtle than most of the ethnographic literature portrays. In Yurok (Native American) shamanic thinking, “The Hawk is not just a beautiful bird who has certain physical characteristics; it is a spiritual source of power. It can be used for seeing because it is a good seer; it can be used for protection [Page [p 312-a]] because it is a strong fighter; it can be used for soul travel because it can fly long distance against great odds and the forces of nature” (Medicine Grizzlybear Lake 1991:4). Sakha believers similarly describe a range of power properties for helper spirits, for example the all-seeing pivot eyes, high flying, and endurance of the eagle, and the acute senses, wisdom, targeted violence, size, and nurturance of the bear. Shamans expect to gain diverse helper spirits over their lifetimes as they build power and expertise..."
t0384 cite0050 RV02 "The seance is more than a tidy liminal ritual system that returns community participants to some status quoante. Spirits, patients, and shamans are interwoven within a constantly adapting symbol system. For example, Konstantin oiuun sewed gifts that grateful patients had given him onto his shamanic cloak. Thus he added the spirit of their love to the bones and metal ornaments symbolizing his connections with helper spirits, including the raven and bear. An elderly Evenk female shaman has given at least one patient a small brass bell that she instructed the patient to ring in emergency, so that the shaman could fly through the tundra to the urban patient’s aid. The patient, touching the bell with awe, explained in 1994 that she has used this boon with success, but sparingly."
t0385 cite0051 AR05 "Their technological skills and knowledge enable the Garos to draw sustenance from the natural environment in which they live. They are also surrounded by a spiritual environment, and though the Garos are remarkably uncertain of its nature, they know that they must behave in appropriate ways toward it if disaster is not to overtake them. Other than me’mang (‘ghost’,) the Garos have only one general term, mite, for supernatural beings; but this covers both beings whom we would call gods and certain lesser, quite different nuisances, which hardly deserve to be known by any term more dignified than spirit. The latter, distinguished from the gods as “the mite that bite,” are numerous and ubiquitous, and when they bite they cause disease. Beyond this, little is concretely known about the mite, [Page 55] and the usual response to a request to describe them more fully is “We don’t know what they look like because we can’t see them. What do you think about them?” Garos were puzzled, for instance, by the question of whether the spirits were male or female. Such questions simply do not arise, and in the Garo language it is possible to talk about a spirit without being forced to choose a third person pronoun indicative of gender. There is no question but that they cause disease, however, and just enough is known of their habits, even if not of their appearance, to allow such action to be taken against them that they will be persuaded to stop biting and permit the sick person to recover. The symptoms of the disease indicate which spirit is causing it, thus allowing those concerned to choose the proper kind of sacrifice. Any Garo can name a few mite, along with the disease that each produces, the place where it lives—or at any rate the place in which the sacrifice to it should be performed—and the manner of the sacrifice. A few men who are more interested or skilled in these matters can give dozens of names. Susume mite, for instance, causes alternate chills and fever, a frequent complaint in this malarial country, and to drive it away an altar of bamboo and leaves must be built in the yard in front of the house. A pig or chicken is sacrificed at this altar, and the animal is eaten. When a spirit known as but causes an attack of dysentery, a small boat is built of bamboo, dabbed with the blood of a sacrificial animal, and floated down the river; and the spirit is supposed to follow it. Other mite are held responsible for paleness, lassitude, skin diseases, and all the other aches and pains which plague the Garos. Each can be pacified with a special form of sacrifice..."
t0386 cite0052 AR05 "The supernatural world of the Garo consists of supernatural beings ( mite) and spirits of dead persons ( me’mang). 13 The Garo do not attribute any form to both of these two categories of beings. However, some supernatural beings are considered as males while others are females (however, in Garo language it is possible to speak about them without mentioning their sex). Both these two categories of supernatural beings act and [Page 66] behave like human beings. When offended they take revenge by causing harm to the offending human beings. The supernatural beings ( mite) cause illness, failure of crops, cause damage to houses by lightning and similar other calamities. The behaviour of supernatural beings can be made to comply with the wishes of human beings by performance of appropriate rites which consist mainly of sacrifices. The common term for illness is mite chika (biting by a spirit). Besides the sex attribute of a few supernatural beings nothing is known about them. The clan organization which pervades all aspects of the society of the living has no meaning in the supernatural world. Magico-religious rites among the Garo are not fraught with functions and such functions are not fraught with too many taboos. Professional shamans, or any other kind of professional intermediaries between human beings and supernaturals are absent among the Garo. Any person who is conversant with the technicalities of magico-religious rites can perform them. However, magico-religious rites performed for the well-being of the community in general are performed by the village priest ( kamal) who is supposed to be well acquainted with the procedure of such rites. There may be several such specialists in the village. Usually after the death of the seniormost the next senior man steps in. The office of the kamal is in no way hereditary. He does not enjoy any special privilege in the village community."
t0387 cite0053 AR07 "Practitioners. The two classes of religious practitioners are the village or state priests and the sacrificers. Both are male. They use the same divinatory techniques of reading broken eggshells and the entrails of cocks, and they both sacrifice cocks, hens, goats, pigs, and cattle. Their skills are not taught to them so much as picked up by observation and confirmed by demonstrations of efficacy. A priest is elected from among the men of his sib to direct his skills to the public good until he dies, and his rewards are institutionalized and come from the village or the state. A sacrificer acts for private persons or kin groups, on call, and is rewarded by them personally with gifts in cash or in kind. The sacrificer is called upon to explain and then to ritually remedy every variety of misfortune, especially illness, though his powers are nowadays regarded with ambivalence, and he is widely expected to become a sorcerer sooner or later. ..."
t0387 cite0053 AR07 "Illness and medicine. In time of illness, a Khasi calls in a sacrificer, and possibly also a medicine man. The medicine man is an ordinary individual who has hit upon some herbal remedy for one or more ailments, who has become famous enough to be sought out and rewarded in cash, and who jealously guards the formula of his medicine until it dies with him. He and his patients tend to regard him as specially blessed."
t0388 cite0054 AW42 "Among the Santals two kinds of ojhas can be seen: those who learn for pleasure’s sake and those who learn seriously and earnestly. In the case of the first no initiations are required after the learning is over, whereas in the second, initiation is the essential part of the learning. To become an ojha (both professional and amateur) one has to be a disciple under an expert ojha . The first course commences in the middle of Jaishtha (May and June), their first sitting being on a Sunday or in some cases on a Friday. Every day they come to the house of the guru after taking their meals. They take their seat in the courtyard of the guru’s house. In the [Page 124] courtyard there is an elevated place, square, or rectangular, the size generally being 1½’ X 1½’ X 1’. It is made of earth, and a Tulsi (Ocymum Sanctum L.) plant is planted in the centre of the mound over which a shed is erected. The shed is so large that it can easily accommodate 10 to 12 persons. The shed is erected by the unmarried disciples, married ones have nothing to do with the erection of the shed. The posts of this shed are of sal wood. In the centre of the shed a hen’s egg and a chir sakom (a thin kind of iron wristlet or arm ornament) are kept for preventing witches from molesting them. The course lasts for four months. A woman cannot be an ojha . The first act of the ojha is what is called Akhra rara which means performing the opening ceremony, to ensure that all may go well and without any hindrance. The first evening the disciples bring along with them some sindur which is given to the guru . In five different places in the courtyard the ojha makes vermilion marks in the name of the following five different bongas :—"

t0389 cite0055 AW42 "Magic and witch-craft are an essential part of the belief of most of the Hinduised tribes and the pre-Dravidian people resident in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Although it cannot be vouched for a certainty as to whether the Santals borrowed it wholesale from the Hindus, there is some internal [Page 309] evidence showing the influence of Hindu ideas on Santal magical practices. In the race of life, the Santal finds inexplicable super-normal phenomena. He does not know how to react to the unknown and unknowable; so he has recourse to magic to deal with the impersonal forces and energies through appropriate rites and spells. This is done not by all the Santals, but only by the Ojha, a specialist in the art of magic and witch-craft. And he is generally the common doctor for all the Hinduised tribes and the Mu[unknown]n[unknown]dà people. What the witchdoctor does is to practise the art of dissociating himself with the aim of spirit-communication, when he chants some magic formulae and makes the patent gestures while he performs the time-honoured rites to conjure the spirits. All these he does with the aid of some spirits, and although his mission is like the priest of religion to attain curative results that endure to the benefit of Santals individually or the tribe taken as a whole, it cannot be said that antisocial results do not follow due to the activities of some malignant Ojhas out to wreak personal vengeance on their enemies with the aid of malevolent spirits."

The other is an ‘evil eye’ specialist who can identify illness caused by ‘evil eye’ projection and who can prescribe countermeasures. A third washerman is training to be a kapuraala . (A kapuraala is a ritual specialist. Further details appear in Chapter V.)

t0391 cite0057 AO07 "Another woman asked the shaman for advice on whether she should buy a piece of land. The shaman then described the characteristics of the land and told the woman that it was not a good land topographically. The woman seemed to agree with her. Another woman asked her about the reason for her family's quarrels and unhappiness. The shaman suggested that she should make offerings to appease the house spirit, who was being angry with her ill-advised deeds. One young girl wanted to know whether her husband would leave his mistress and come back to her. In that case the shaman advised her to keep calm. It was the husband's nature to have a number of mistresses. If the wife could keep silent, the family would prosper, and so on."
t0391 cite0057 AO07 "The shaman certainly plays a useful role in the village. Those who have nowhere to turn can find a psychological refuge in her. Whether the possession is absolutely real is not particularly important. So far as she keeps her financial demand within a limit, bribery would be out of the question. The point is, she is able to give [Page 54] reasonable advice. Certain cures are psychological rather than physical, for a certain illness is sometimes psychological anyway. We must admit that she possesses more than the usual intelligence. With the quickness of wit she can handle various situations with ease. Her advice is valid in a sense that it is considered so by her patients."

Almost all stages of rice cultivation can be marked by some simple ritual designed to ensure success. Sickness may be explained and treated in terms of the actions of spirits, the withdrawal of the gods' protective influence, or loss of a spirit of the body. Further treatments include the use of magical herbal medicines and other techniques practised by ritual specialists. There is also a whole host of [Page 183] protective charms varying from privately recited formulas to tattoos and many types of amulet which make one invulnerable to bullets or knife wounds, or which ensure success in such ventures as winning the love of another."
t0393 cite0059 AO07 "It is evident that in Buddhism the Thai intellectual has a Weltanschauung which is both satisfactory and comfortable. This faith in traditional religion has saved him from heart-rending introspection and self-criticism and has preserved for him a matter-of-fact approach to life. The Thai intellectual is above all pragmatic rather than speculative ... Most educated Thai are officials faced daily with the stubborn facts of life. They are not therefore given to flights of imagination. They fit comfortably into an established structure of social organization. They are not stimulated by idleness and failure to an examination of the [Page 42] fundamentals of that structure or of the ultimate values upon which it is based. In a very real sense, the educated group is a class with a vested interest. Consequently it is conservative and pragmatic rather than radical and speculative."
t0393 cite0059 AO07 "The closest approximation to a psychological literature resulting from these fundamental intellectual orientations are religious and secular didactic essays, public school texts on morality, self-help or “peace of mind” tracts, and satirical or didactic fiction and poetry. (Mosel 1961 provides an excellent discussion of contemporary Thai poetry.)"
t0393 cite0059 AO07 "1  Although this is not the place to go into a detailed discussion of Thai intellectual life and its effects on native psychological theory and the lack of an analytic literature, it might help to realize that Thai intellectual commentators are still principally a literati rather than an intelligentsia, in the sense that Redfield (1953: 42–44, and Redfield and Singer 1954), following Childe and Toynbee, explicitly used these terms; that is, they are (Redfield and Singer 1954) specialists who “reflect, synthesize and create out of the traditional material new arrangements and developments that are felt by the people to be outgrowths of the old. What is changed is a further statement of what was before... The ‘literati’ who fashion a Great Tradition do not repudiate the values and outlook of their rural hinterland but systematize and elaborate them under technical specialization.” An intelligentsia, on the other hand, is comprised of heretics, dissenters, and marginal men who challenge, interrupt, or destroy the ancient traditions to bring forth totally new intellectual orientations. They are the “cosmopolitan” individuals who historically tend to arise only after the native civilization has come into prolonged contact with or is stimulated by foreign cultures and ideas."
t0393 cite0059 AO07 "This distinction is not only taxonomically useful, but in Thailand's case seems to fit with actual historical circumstances ... Throughout these years, the intellectuals, as literati associated with the court (and often the court itself: some of Thailand's greatest poets and dramatists were kings) helped maintain, develop, and glorify this civilization, but not change it radically. ... In this type of [politically autonomous] intellectual environment, still oriented toward the synthesis and integration of the new into the old, it is not surprising to find a Western-trained Thai psychiatrist describe Sigmund Freud as a person “who did not have too much to say because he wrote only about sex.” Perhaps the most fitting characterization of the values underlying the purposes of the Thai intellectual is provided by the motto of The Siam Society, the one major association in Thailand approximating a society of scholars, which is “Knowledge Produces Friendship.”"
t0394 cite0060 AO07 "The use of dangerously polluted material in love magic occurs when a man resorts to the strongest magical means known to ensure the love of a woman. It entails putting but a single drop of námman phraaj, the fluid which magical practitioners extract from certain corpses, 1 in the food of the woman. Upon swallowing the food, she will become totally enslaved to the man. This occurs only rarely, because námman phraaj is rare. Only a specialist with great magical powers will try to obtain the liquid from the corpse of a person who died inauspiciously, preferably from the most dangerous kind of corpse: that of a woman who died whilst pregnant or during childbirth. Reputedly, in the deep of the night the lay magical specialist approaches the place where such a corpse lies. He should grasp the dead body firmly in his arms, and extract some liquid from the skull by holding a lighted candle under the chin of the cadaver. A terrible struggle may ensue before the corpse releases some of this námman phraaj. The liquid is extremely dangerous, and in present times there are only a few men who are reputed to possess it. Only a desperate man will try to use it as love magic, for whilst it certainly causes a woman to be enslaved to a man, it may make her very ill at the same time. It is said that she may become mentally deranged for the rest of her life by consuming some of the liquid."
t0395 cite0060 AO07 "It is apparent to these young people that the paraphernalia used during ceremonies often serve a symbolic function. Betel leaves and areca nuts can be used in a ritual and then they seem to indicate the concepts of agreement, harmony and understanding. Gold-and-silver leaves are present whenever it is appropriate to include the ideas of prosperity and wealth. Rág-leaves appear when it is necessary to stress the concept of love. It is more difficult in many cases to decypher the messages of, for example, a tray with unhusked rice, puffed rice, green peas and sesame seed. Such knowledge is reserved for the ritual specialist who prescribes and prepared the ingredients during elaborate ceremonies. The young people may regard it as esoteric lore."
t0396 cite0060 AO07 "In former times, the timber for building a house could not be bought from another person, but had to be gathered in a forest by the man who built the home, accompanied and assisted by his intimate friends. They often took the ritual specialist along in order to decide which trees were auspicious. The specialist selected trees which grew in favourable positions, and made sure that the types of wood selected were considered auspicious in ritual lore. Wood considered auspicious was, for example, máaj [unknown] ( Shorea obtusa) and máaj [unknown] ( Pentacme siamensis). A good timber tree, but dangerous because of its reputed attraction to certain spirits was máaj takhian ( Serianthes grandiflora, Erythophloeum succirubrum). Most of the trees which were considered inauspicious were unsuitable for housebuilding; they rotted quickly, were easily devoured [Page 164] by insects, were too wet or too heavy. One tree, although useful as timber, was avoided because its name máaj [unknown] ( Afzelia xylocarpe), sounded inauspicious since the syllable khâa was associated with the Thai word for ‘to kill’, ‘to murder’. In modern times, timber factories sell this wood under a new name, máaj [unknown], a name suggesting an increase in happiness. The woodcutters took great care to let the trees fall in an auspicious direction, and the ritual specialist was at hand to interpret the creaking sounds in the wood just before falling. These sounds were seen as a communication from the spirit of the wood, the [unknown]."

He recites, in a sonorous voice, the story of how man reaches maturity, all the parental hardships, in particular, those of the mother who went through pregnancy, the labour of childbirth, and child rearing. The nak [* AL: candidate monks, after their time abiding to 227 precepts ] who are dressed in a white robe bow low and listen meekly to the recitation about their growth due to their parents. There are some who shed tears from the overwhelming realization as never before of just how much their parents have done for them."

Most of those who attend this ritual present the nak's parents with an envelope containing a small amount of money as an act of mutual help and a means of merit-making as well."
t0398 cite0062 OG11 "The only way a girl could train herself for her task, if she wanted to become a priestess, was to accompany a priestess regularly whenever the latter went to do her work with sick people. This going into apprenticeship is called mobanda (what the apprentice gives to the priestess as recompense for the instruction is also called banda ). The apprentices sit close to their mistress and parrot the litanies that they hear her recite. The time that they need to master the litany varies greatly. It has happened that little girls had memorized several pieces from the litany as a hobby before they seriously became apprentices of a priestess, so that their learning time took only a few months. In some areas the pupils were given finely chopped Cordyline stalks to eat in order to make them proficient quickly. Cordyline, after all, is the plant that is used a great deal by the priestesses. Sometimes too the apprentices chew splinters of guideposts which indicate the direction in which pointed bamboos and spring-lances are set. It is claimed that apprentices who are able to knot together the needles of the sawadjane (a kind of needle-bearing tree) will quickly learn the art."

A masseuse ( topopagere ) is then called. She feels the sick person and then maintains that his liver has indeed disappeared from his body. It is said that the werewolf has stuffed tree leaves in the body in place of it. As proof, she brings these to light. She also tries to provide the patient with a new liver. For this she squeezes a chicken liver into little pieces with her fingernails above the pit of the sick person’s stomach and then blows on it. People believe that the chicken liver enters the body [Page 261] and replaces the lost liver. Those who are said to understand this method of curing well go to work in the following way: they take for this a large leaf from one tree or another and make a cut in it. They now put the leaf on the pit of the stomach and suppose that with this a cut has been made in the stomach. A chicken liver is now stuck into the leaf through the cut, after which the medical practitioner blows on it with all her strength. She knows how to spirit away the liver, and now it is said to have moved into the body of the sufferer."
t0400 cite0062 OG11 "As we have already seen, indispositions are generally ascribed to causes that come from outside. For this reason the treatment of a sick person is completely external; the idea of “taking in” medicines was originally strange for the Toradja. The medicine is applied externally to the sick parts. The way in which this is usually applied is to chew the medicine and then to spit it on the body, actually to puff ( mosoepa ). The medicine is then mixed with the saliva and the breath of the medical expert, which makes it even more beneficial."
t0401 cite0062 OG11 "The priestesses often apply this method, but the ordinary medical expert uses it, too. If, for instance, during a fever the entire body is swollen, the leaves of the banta tree are cut into pieces and mixed with water; with this water the swollen body is washed or wet; rope made from the Gnetum gnemon L. ( soeka ) is rubbed with the sap of the banta (the so-called oela banta ) to make it durable; people also want to achieve this effect on the patient’s body by means of the bath."

The ancestors are of concern to everyone. Shamans (TADU) are principally curers. They have guardian spirits whom they can send to the other worlds to retrieve people's souls and cure illness. Soul loss is believed to be a widespread cause of illness. There are also other religious practitioners with particular skills such as in curing smallpox or rainmaking. These are called SANDO, and can be either men or women. Divination and soothsayers (MONTOGOE) are important for understanding the will and guidance of gods and spirits. Another person with a religious function is the head-hunting leader or TADULAKO. In former times, witches and sorcerers were also significant figures in the society (Downs 1956: 37ff.)."

The method by which sorcery was learned was secret, but it was said that its practitioners had a special object, shaped like a cucumber, which was the source of their power. When its owner rubbed his or her hand over it it imparted something to it that made others who came into contact with it sick. The possesser of such an object was, moreover, forced to use it, as if he didn’t it would make him sick (II, 176)."

Membuas always takes the shape of a Banded Kingfisher. When any one of the seven birds is seen or heard by an Iban, this is believed to be a pronouncement by the gods, either commending, or cautioning against, a proposed course of action. Everything then depends on interpreting the prognostication aright, and assenting to it with zeal. Many details must be taken into account: the precise movements of the bird, the type of cry it uttered, and the exact time and place of the event. Each bird is regarded as having a special character of its own, and to be associated with varying kinds of activity. Furthermore when two birds of different species are encountered in close succession (as often happens), it is their joint meaning which must then be taken into reckoning. Because of all these variable factors, the whole system is exceedingly complex, and to become an expert augur a man must go through many years of diligent and patient apprenticeship."

Real experts ( orang pandai ) are few; there is not always one in a longhouse. These offer their opinion only when specifically asked. Limbang, for example, explained once that, to judge by the liver he was shown, it was quite obvious to him that a sick Delok child would die, but since the others seemed satisfied with it, he said nothing. The child died."
t0406 cite0067 OA19 "Since the names of the ancestors of the first class, those who are termed “ancestors of the other side”, cannot be the same for all households, since, moreover, there are but a few priests, expert genealogists, it is necessary that those in whose behalf the sacrifice is offered inform the actual performer about the names of their ancestors or at least about the names of those who head the various lines of descent. Consequently all households must know their pedigrees, or if actually they don’t know, because they are rather young, they have to call one of their relatives who knows and who can inform the priest. Should they not do so, should they allow the priest to go on with the rites notwithstanding the fact that his initial invocation of ancestors was defective on account of lack of information, they would surely displease those among the ancestors they did not call, who afterwards, as they believe, may take their revenge by causing illness or death."

The land was more thoroughly cultivated, and the village boasted a number of local specialists. These specializations were linked with particular family lines. Certain families were blacksmiths; others were undertakers, joiners, cobblers, or midwives. As generations succeeded one another, occupations were not thrown open in the competitive, individualistic way of the mobile city.

t0409 cite0069 EP04 "It is small wonder that the Lapps had a high opinion of the bear at a time when there were no firearms. The bear is bigger, stronger, and wiser than all the other animals; at the same time he is very swift and nimble. He can climb trees, and he can walk on two feet like a man. His habit of sleeping during the winter is so extraordinary that there seems to be something supernatural about it. And yet an expert Lapp bear hunter did not fear the strength and dexterity of the individual bear. When the bear was roused from its sleep and came out through the narrow opening of its den, drowsy and bewildered, the hunter had to direct his spear towards the breast of the beast and keep it steadily, pressing the shaft end to the ground and avoiding the grip of the approaching bear. This was a dangerous job, but if he should fail, there were companions present to come to his assistance. The real danger came from the invisible (magic) power which was inherent in every bear. We risk rationalizing the ideas of the ancient Lapps too much if we say that they thought that the bear had a genius or guardian spirit. They did not distinguish sharply between the individual and the species. No doubt in their incantations they invoked the species or the invisible power which was inherent in all the individuals, but they could not help addressing, after the successful hunting expedition, the very sample which they had just killed. When they wanted the bear to come back to be killed again (a wording which they carefully avoided), did they mean that the very same individual bear should return? I think it would be a psychological mistake to press this question."

First went the man who had “ringed in” the bear; he carried a staff with a brass ring at its end. (Brass was the sacral metal of the Lapps; almost all vessels and implements that had anything to do with the bear ritual should be made of brass, or at any rate they should be adorned with this metal.) Then came the sorcerer, and next came the man who was charged with the killing of the beast. There were also other distinguished functionaries, for instance the wood-carrier and the water-carrier necessary for the subsequent banquet..."
t0409 cite0069 EP04 "Having killed the bear, the hunters (or one of them?) sang a song in which they thanked him for having been gentle enough not to damage their spears. (Maybe they had before the killing asked the bear not to bite or claw the hunter, as the ancient Finns did according to the forty-sixth song of Kalevala. ) Then they lashed the dead beast with twigs. The purpose of this obviously was to confer vital force upon the bear, to give him a kind of substitute or compensation for the life which he had been deprived of. The jocose habit of rousing the children in the morning of Easter Sunday by lashing them with a birch twig, which has survived up to these days in the Scandinavian countries even among the urban population, has the same magic background, namely the belief that the life-force which is inherent in budding twigs can be transferred to living beings. ..."

By doing so they improved [Page 160] their chances to be successful on later hunting expeditions. The killer would also wind a birch twig around the lower jaw of the bear, attach his belt to this ring, and then repeatedly jerk the beast from its position, singing a cheerful song all the time. It may be that this action was an alternative to the lashing."
t0409 cite0069 EP04 "The hunters covered the bear with spruce twigs, and leaving it on the spot till the following day, they went home. When they came near to the dwelling place, they sang a song about their feat. The women answered by singing a song, praising the bold hunters."
t0409 cite0069 EP04 "According to some sources, the man who had killed the bear should keep in his hand a whip plaited of birch twigs and beat with it thrice on the back entrance of the tent or hut. There is some obscurity in the tradition concerning this detail. Probably we have here to deal with the same twigs already mentioned in connection with the killing of the bear, and these twigs seem to have played an important role in the whole bear ceremonial almost from the beginning. The plait was handed over to one of the women (the wife of the killer?) and wrapped up in a linen cloth. During the festival it was decorated with brass leaves and the like. After the banquet the vertebrae of the bear were threaded on the plait in their natural order and then buried together with the other bones of the beast."
t0409 cite0069 EP04 "The hunters were not allowed to sleep with their wives until three days after they had killed the bear; for the leader of the hunting the celibacy lasted five days. And then they had to undergo a special purifying ceremony. Each of them should run around the hearth, imitating a bear, and when he ran out of the tent, his wife threw hot ashes after him."
t0409 cite0069 EP04 "In some regions at least, the men and the women are the bear together, after the meat had been brought into the ten through the back entrance and cooked by one of the men, but there were several restrictions regarding the women. They were forbidden to eat certain parts of the bear, their portions had to be boiled in a separate kettle, and the pieces of boiled meat had to be handed over to them on wooden sticks. And according to a still more strict [Page 161] observance, the men raised a tent or hut for themselves, where they did all the cooking and spent all their time, day and night, as long as the festival lasted. Half-grown children were sent from the men's tent to bring the women their portions."
t0410 cite0070 EP04 "Aspen wood has sometimes been used for skis, which were light and hard (in the Skolt areas in Petsamo), and for pails and barrels; in Utsjoki alder has been used for bowls and cups, but otherwise only alder bark is used for tanning hides. In Inari aspen is hardly used at all, even for firewood, as it takes a long time to dry. Birdcherry wood can be used for hoops, hames, and pipe stems; willow and sallow for hoops; mountain ash for hoops, rakes, and handles. “A hoop made of mountain ash and a pole made of spruce lasts one's whole life.” Mountain-ash bark has sometimes been used for tanning. Juniper can be used for wooden nails, rakes, handles, pegs, and for small implements attached to fishing tackles."
t0410 cite0070 EP04 "Use of wood and opinions about the different qualities of wood vary according to locality. A Mountain Lapp naturally makes observations different from those of a forest dweller."
t0410 cite0070 EP04 "Wood for building purposes is felled when one comes across a suitable tree in the forest. If all of it cannot be taken along, the rest is left for another occasion. If a great quantity of wood is needed, it is transported in reindeer sleds. Carpenters keep wood stored at home. Some men are so interested in woodwork that they cannot make any conversation except about wood. An old man in Utsjoki called Tor'te-t[unknown] seähtsi (“Uncle Spinning Wheel”) had gathered so much wood in his home that he could hardly find room enough to sleep in. Boats and sleds require the longest time to prepare, but making a spinning wheel requires the greatest skill. Specialists in making spinning wheels have been known in Utsjoki since at least the middle of the previous century.-- Whoever sees a good tree in the forest 468 can mark it by carving a notch in the trunk, if he is not able to fell the tree right away (I. Rein.). Different type, of trees, such as pine, birch, straight, and curved trees, are felled at the same time and loaded in a sled. At home the wood is piled near the left wall of the hut. The work is done out-of-doors. The working place ( feärrâm-sâddi ) is located at a distance of about one-half a lasso from the hut to the left of the door. A big log ( f. pel'ko ) marks the place. The place for cutting firewood ( t[unknown] suollâm-sâddi ) is situated a little further off, marked also by a log ( smahk'ko-muonâ ). In the evening the men carve small objects in the hut. Bigger objects, such as keels for sleds and boats, sledges, and skis, are made out-of-doors when the weather permits. Formerly the reindeer herders had a free period of about four weeks, beginning in the middle of May, when the reindeer cows were left to roam freely. This period was spent in repairing ( tivvuh ) and building. The wood dried quickly at this time of the year (I. Rein.). The settled lapps carried on woodwork throughout the year. Almost every man is able to make the wooden dishes and other objects needed in the household, but special masters ( t[unknown] seähp'pi “smith”) are needed for making sleds and boats."
t0411 cite0071 EP04 "If a big male attacks an?rily, the man has to run behind a tree or bush, with one hand grabbing hold of its antlers, while the other grabs the lower jaw between the incisors and the molars. 2 If the jaw is squeezed and the antler is pressed from the middle while raising the jaw, the animal may be thrown to the ground, as it cannot now make resistance. If the male is caught by lasso, as it usually is, one man turns the antlers slowly but strongly until they touch the ground, then he “twists” ( pońâstih , teäd'dili? ) and the male is down, lying on its right flank. [Page 251] The other man sits down on top of it, astride, pressing down the antlers and turning the faw upwards. The feller jumps to bite, lying down on all fours, with his head between the animal's legs. The castrator has to have strong, unbroken teeth; even some women habe been able to do this. The testicles ( p[unknown] alluh ) are bitten either bare, or, more rarely, through a mitten, until they burst; then, carefully biting and squeezing with the fingers, they are “ground ( t[unknown] sar'vuh ) to spawn” and pressed under the surrounding skin to be reabsorbed by the connective tissues. A skilled man may castrate about ten reindeer a day, but he is capable of doing this only a few days a week, otherwise his maxillary joints will soften. A certain reindeer-Lapp said in the evening after work: “today it was a hard job ( pâr'gu “work”), I “bit” eleven males ( käs'kem )”. Two or three castrations may be executed every day. Young boys begin to practice at fifteen years and go on as long as their teeth are sound. Sometimes the castration is made with a knife; this method has also to be used if the scrotum bursts while biting. However, it is said that such a reindeer becomes velvet-antlered, has poor appetite and is weak and easily tired."
t0412 cite0071 EP04 "The sorcerer ( nóai'di ) was an important person, a healer as well as a sacrificial priest, who was able to repel evil and obtain insight into the gods' wills. Some were sorcerers by innate talent; they were taught by the spirits through illnesses. The first case of illness would occur during childhood; the second - in youth - increased their wisdom, and the third, occurring during the years of manhood, gave the finishing touches to the skill. The sorcerer rarely [Page 645] held his position beyond his 50th year. He had to be in perfect health, since the loss of even one tooth meant that he was no longer considered fully competent. 1 A certain amount of sorcerer's knowledge was passed on from father to son, and additional knowledge could be obtained through practice, even if such a practitioner never attained first-class competence. The flying sorcerers ( kir'di-nóai'di ) were the most eminent, as they were able to fly like gusts or birds, and also to appear in the shapes of other animals. The trance-sorcerers were of another class, as their souls were held to be able to move outside their bodies during uncon-sciousness, e.g. in the shape of an animal, wolf, bear, wild reindeer or fish. If such an animal was then injured, it remained forever in the sorcerer's body. The less talented sorcerers were considered able to bring back such things as stolen goods through the mere power of the word or by other means. There were benevolent as well as evil sorcerers, as was the case with their assistant spirits ( nóaide-k[unknown] adtsih ). ..."
t0412 cite0071 EP04 "A certain merchant from Tornio wanted to test the skill of a Lapp and promised him a reward if he could send his spirit to Tornio, about 70 miles away. When the Lapp had drunk some liquor, he fell into a trance and made the journey to and fro in one hour. He had visited the merchant's house, taken along his wife's gold ring and other objects, and told the most reliable details about his visit. The merchant took the objects, and after his return home asked his wife if she had lost them. The latter acknowledged that it had happened on the very day the Lapp had been sent to the house."
t0412 cite0071 EP04 "J. Fellman gives many examples of well-known sorcerers' skills. The Inari-Lapp Kuvva once escorted wild reindeer from Kittilä to Inari, but Peiva[unknown] s sent them back (according to another version the animals were escorted from the districts of Tuntsa and Kouta). Once when the sorcerer P[unknown] avu[unknown] s-Niila “transferred,” while singing in the Lapp fashion, an enormous wild reindeer herd from Kolt-Lapland to Utsjoki, where there had been no wild reindeer before, they were followed by Kolt-Lapp sorcerers in the shape of three wild reindeer males. But Niila's sister, a famous sorceress, [Page 647] swished her skirts and out of them came nine wolves that rushed at the three males. Niila and his sister attached a wild reindeer female, saying: “even the grandson will find a wild reindeer at this place.”"
t0413 cite0072 EP04 "The Second is to find out a proper Remedy, viz . what Sort of Sacrifice will be most pleasing to their Gods, but especially to Storjunkare , without whose peculiar Favour they never hope to recover their Health. The beforementioned Author proceeds thus: This done, the Patient must make a Vow of a certain Sacrifice, of a Raindeer, Buil, He-Goat or Ram, or something else of this Kind, to be offered to some certain Storjunkare, dwelling in some certain Mountain or other . Neither is it left to the Choice of the Patient, but to the direction of the Drum-beater; it being his Province to prescribe, what they ought to do. Whatever the Drummer orders the Patient to do , says the same Author, he must perform, and either Sacrifice immediately, or at least promise to offer such a Sacrifice at a certain appointed Time . For it is the Business of him, who beats the Drum, to enquire (as I told you before) which of the Gods the Sacrifice is to be offered to, and what kind of Sacrifice will be acceptable to him; for the same Sacrifice is not pleasing to every one of their Gods, neither is the same God satisfied with one kind of Sacrifices at all times; so that the choice of it depends on the Manager of the Drum, whose direction the sick Person is to follow. The manner of performing it, is thus described by Samuel Rheen: When they pretend to Cure any Distemper by the help of the Drum, it is done in the following manner: The Patient must present the Drummer with two Rings, as a Reward for his Pains, one of Brass, the other of Silver; both which he tyes to his right Arm. The Drummer, after having put those two Rings in the same Bunch, [Page 148] which commonly is made use of, as often as the Drum is employed for those Purposes, beats the said Drum, singing all the while, as do likewise all the Men and Women there present, the first with a loud Voice, the latter somewhat lower . From the Motion and Position of the Rings, the Drum-beater makes his Conjecture, as we told you before. Lundius gives the following Account concerning this Method: If a Laplander happen to fall Sick in the Lapmark of Uma , they send for the next Neighbour, whom they think most expert in the management of the Drum. The first Thing to be done after his coming is, to Sacrifice one of the best Raindeer, belonging to the sick Body, or to his best Friend; then he begins to beat his Drum, and falling on the Ground, remains there for some time unmoveable, his Body being as hard as a Stone. In the mean while the rest there present sing a certain Song, which they have been taught by him beforehand, till he recovers his Senses, arises, takes up his Drum, and holding it up to his Head, beats it softly for some small time. After which he sits down very pensive, and begins to give them an Account of his Transactions; he tells them, that he has passed thro' the Body of the Terrestrial Globe, where he has met with the Antipodes, being conducted by his Genius, among a People of a very handsome and venerable Aspect; those People, he says, being advertised of his coming, had shut their Gates against him, but that by the affistance of his Genius, he had got among them thro' a Hole, where he had seen something belonging to the Sick Person, either his Hat, his Shoes, or perhaps his Mittens, or some such like Thing, which he was either able or unable to bring away. Their gencral Opinion is, That if the Drummer did bring it away, there is great Hopes of the Patients recovery, but if not, that he will Dye, and endure a great deal of Pain. And because they are fully persuaded, that the Soul of the Drummer does actually leave his Body and is carried to the Place he Names to them; they say that his Soul is brought back by his Genius over the highest Rocks and Mountains, with such swiftness, that the Sand and Stones doe flye about like Hail. Mr. Paul Venetus relates something not unlike this of the Tartars of the Province of Areladam . And these are the Things commonly performed by this Drum."
t0414 cite0073 EF06 "Most villager conjurers (again Branko is an exception) have an articulated aesthetic concerning the right way to accomplish all tasks. In snake-bite rituals, as with all Serbian healing rites, not only must the procedure be repeated three times, as we have seen, but the entire process must be done on each of three successive days. People say it should be done after noon, when the sun begins its journey downward (another mythic theme), carrying off the trouble with the waning day (Kerewsky-Halpern and Foley 1978a:922)."
t0414 cite0073 EF06 "Once, I remember, the owner of a sick cow couldn’t wait until noon. Well before daybreak one rainy morning he goaded his sick cow down the lane, across the cornfields, and into the dark, muddied yard. I heard Branko curse and get out of bed. He grabbed a flashlight and hurried to get on with it — he too felt no need to wait until noon, and in any case his rest was already disrupted. He yelled for me to get my flashlight and come out to the yard, where he was flicking raindrops off his nose and racing through the three recitations of the charm."
t0414 cite0073 EF06 "That part completed, we went with both flashlights down to a gully behind his pasture to obtain a ritual accessory. What is required is a small branch of leskova drva hazel (Corylus Avellana), valued as a restorative wood, nut-bearing and therefore life-giving. 13 We slogged up from the gully with the requisite branch, and Branko stripped it and fashioned it into a small cross, stooping to pull out a blade of long grass along the fence to use to bind the twigs. He placed the cross on the cow’s rump and suddenly remembered that he was supposed to perform the incantations with the cross in place. Muttering an oath under his breath, he repeated the charm three times, with an aside to me that it was a good thing I wasn’t recording it because it was not kako treba as it should be . “Ali ako,” he said ( But what of it )."
t0414 cite0073 EF06 "13 The name Ora[unknown]sac derives from orah walnut . That nut-bearing tree is relatively abundant in the village and is not considered to have restorative power equivalent to hazel. For an exploration of the spirits who reside in trees and wood see Bynum (1978). “Knock on wood” in our own culture is an identical response to this ancient belief."
t0414 cite0073 EF06 "Under usual conditions, after the placement of the cross and the performance of the charm the three times, the cow’s ears are lifted and the practitioner blows into them “to make sure she has heard the words.” Then the owner is instructed on subsequent treatment. The inflamed area is to be beaten lightly (massaged) with boughs of burjan dwarf elder (Sambucus ebulus), readily found throughout the village and known to herbalists for its soothing qualities. The next day the calf is put to suck or the inflamed teat milked (a procedure beneficial in mastitis). And, after three days of repetition of the charm and the rest, the “snake bite” subsides. Evil is banished, and in addition Branko’s reputation is reinforced."
t0415 cite0074 EF06 "The third outstanding manipulative method of restoring the viscera to their proper place is distinctly curious. The treatment is a specialist monopoly. At Kralje the doctor rubs the veins and arteries of the left arm, from hand to elbow. At Vare[unknown]s, in Bosnia, he takes hold of the arteries in the patient’s back between the thumb and first finger, and follows the course of the blood vessels with pressure above them to the armpit, or starting from between the thumb and first finger traces those which lead up the left arm. Elsewhere vigorous rubbing between the thumb and finger of the left hand is considered to be curative, or rubbing the muscles under the left shoulder blade. Again, the operator places his own thumb and first finger between the patient’s left thumb and first finger, and presses upwards as hard as he can. If the patient is unable to bear or withstand the pressure, it is a sign that he is suffering from strunja . The doctor plucks at the blood vessels under the armpit in Serbia. The doctor rubs the arteries down the left palm of the patient, following the inner side of the arm up to the biceps, and where the blood vessels appear to form a knot he catches hold of the flesh and pinches it firmly between his fingers, while an assistant fastens a cord tightly round the arm at that point. The patient should then lie on his left arm, perfectly still for a couple of hours, until the arm is numbed. The bandage is then loosened a little, and the patient again lies down in the same position. What the theoretical connection may be between the displacement of the viscera and the blood vessels of the left side of the body is not clear."
t0416 cite0075 SB05 "This last point deserves some discussion. When a young Kuna becomes a disciple of an experienced curing specialist he places himself in a thoroughly submissive position with regard to his teacher. Once the branch of knowledge he wishes to learn has been decided upon and fixed, the specialist controls the manner in which instruction proceeds, the sequence in which all knowledge is passed out, and the topics to be discussed during each session. The first stages usually deal with etiquette, the most important rule at this point being that the student should refrain from asking questions. The duties and responsibilities of a curing specialist are detailed and stressed: he should be humble, the corollary being that he should respect his teacher; he should not undertake to learn ritual knowledge for selfish reasons; and he should never criticize other specialists (a rule that is contradicted a good deal in actual fact)."
t0416 cite0075 SB05 "When learning proper begins, the student characteristically listens attentively to a short portion of a chant several times, then is told to repeat it. When he has mastered this task adequately, another piece of the chant is given to him in the same fashion, and he repeats it. On and on it goes until the entire chant has been learned. As the student progresses and demonstrates his capacity for learning he is given information or symbols and their underlying meanings, commentaries on the nature of curing and disease in general, and instruction in accompanying ritual. Such information is conveyed to the student either by demonstration or verbally. [Page 48] But the important point is that it is done when the teacher -- not the student -- considers the time is right. If the professor wants to discourse on the domain of a particular spirit residing in the jungle, he will do so, and on his own time. If he wants to collect medicines one day, the student may follow along. And if he decides to pass on some esoteric information about the plants being gathered -- or if he decides not to -- that is the way things will happen. Instruction is paced, regulated, and nothing comes before its time: the deepest meanings, the most intricate and sensitive details, all are left until the student has demonstrated his soundness of character and his capacity to handle the knowledge in question."
t0417 cite0075 SB05 "It was difficult for most of the specialists to conceive of a different system of teaching, and until I managed to adapt myself (at least partially) to their expectations it was apparent that they considered me a strange bird indeed. As I was working with small gifts and favors (such as assisting them on their farms or fishing), which was the same sort of arrangement they enjoyed with their regular students, I was expected to fall in line. While they continued to view me as fundamentally different from their usual students and generally put up with my obtuse habit of asking too many questions, it rapidly became clear that they felt more confortable if I sat back and listened to what they had to say. Whenever I initiated a session with a simple question like “Is X a kind of curing chant?,” the answer frequently lasted for half an hour or longer [Page 49] and ran across terrain far afield of my original focus. In the end, to cut down on frustration on all sides, I adopted the tactic of identifying a general topic and letting the specialist develop it as he saw fit, or even waiting for a topic to arise in the course of casual conversation and letting it proceed naturally with no more than a few interjections for clarification. Of course, things changed as my knowledge of curing grew. With most specialists, the monologues became less frequent and I was able to direct the sessions more along my own lines, filling in gaps with more specific information. But my schooling was still largely in their hands. Some of the specialists even occasionally produced lectures on subjects they thought I should know, gauging them closely to my level of understanding at the time."
t0418 cite0075 SB05 "The Baptist doctor stationed at the hospital in Ailikanti once told me (in rebuttal to the belief that primitive peoples are without mental illness) that he had recently run across two men who were, in his words, “insane.” One man, he said, claimed to have an eagle clawing at his chest, while the second man complained of having an armadillo in his back. It turned out [Page 110] that the man with the eagle was suffering from jabbing chest pains which had been diagnosed by a Kuna specialist as the claws of an eagle poni digging into his purpa. Years earlier, he had ingested the heart of an eagle to improve his hunting skills, and the spiritual eagle, which had been incorporated into his purpa, had turned upon him. The other man was afflicted with an armadillo poni which had crept inside his purpa and was rolling itself in a ball, thus causing him to walk about with his shoulders bent forward."
t0419 cite0075 SB05 "A common medium through which ponikana [spirits causing ailments] attack is dreams, for all dreams are set in the realm of spirit. In this realm, the purpa of a sleeping individual sometimes journeys far afield into unfamiliar landscapes populated with strange beings and filled with peril. Ritual specialists, in particular, are [Page 113] subject to dreams in which their purpakana visit the domains of dangerous spirits, and while the specialists sometimes learn from these excursions there is always a good measure of risk involved. One specialist recounted to me a dream in which he ventured into the bowels of a huge ship, passed two growling jaguars tethered by stout chains, and came to a bare room in which a sinister man with the face of a bat was biting a woman on the neck. The specialist rapidly retreated to the surface and made his way to shore. The same man said that on several occasions he had been invited, while dreaming, to drop down into the lower levels of the cosmos, but had always declined the invitiations out of fear."
t0419 cite0075 SB05 "From time to time, dangerous spirits appear in human form, catching the unsuspecting dreamer off guard and tricking him into indiscretions which result in purpa damage. Several years ago, a young woman from Ustuppu dreamed that she had sexual intercourse with a youth she had never seen before. She told no one of this nocturnal affair, and after some three months gave birth to a clutch of turtle eggs. Her mother found out but decided, unwisely, to maintain secrecy. Shortly thereafter, the neighbors began to hear water gurgling beneath the ground, and a rumor spread that the ponikana living there were offended by some human infraction and were going to send a tidal wave over the island. Somehow, the girl’s dream became known and was immediately connected to the subterranean noises. A nele (‘seer’) peered into the spirit world and discovered that [Page 114] the girl’s sexual partner had not been a man, but a sea turtle poni in disguise. 7 Another woman in the Cartí region became pregnant and gave birth to a child with huge red eyes, claws, and thick hair covering most of its body. She had likewise engaged in sexual intercourse with a stranger while dreaming, and the stranger had turned out to be a whale poni. 8"
t0419 cite0075 SB05 "7 This woman was taken to a small uninhabited island near the mainland and given medicines to drive the turtle poni out of her system. The medicines were so powerful that she fell into a coma and died."
t0419 cite0075 SB05 "8 The child either died at birth or was killed by the midwives in the birth house. The woman was given medicines and survived."
t0420 cite0075 SB05 "Several informants on Ustuppu told me that a person with strong nika emits a noise like a growling motor, which is audible only to the spirits, and that this noise warns the ponikana in the area to stay away. Nordenskiold’s principal informant, Rubén Pérez Kantule, drew for him a picture of “...a person and around him a sort of smoke cloud and afterwards explained that when evil spirits come against this they go around in order to search for an opening and when they fail to find one they cannot get at the person surrounded by niga.” (Ibid.) A strong nika, then, is something like a suit of armor which effectively repels the incursion of dangerous spirits."
t0420 cite0075 SB05 "When someone has been debilitated by illness his nika is reduced, and it is unwise for him to leave the confines of his home until it has been built up again. If a sick person, or someone who has just recovered from a prolonged bout with ponikana, must venture afield he will often paint his face with achiote to mask his palid appearance and give the ponikana the impression that he is strong and healthy. But even so he will be taking a risk, as the following story demonstrates:"
t0420 cite0075 SB05 "Years ago Peret was ill. His face was washed of color and he was weak, but he decided to go fishing anyway. He painted his face red and paddled out to sea. After having some success he returned to the island and was beaching his canoe when he spotted a large fish just off the rocks. He picked up his spear and tried to stab it, then suddenly grew faint and fell unconscious in the water. Some people standing nearby saw this happen and pulled him out. They managed to revive him, but he ached all over and was shaking. A curing specialist was summoned and ascertained that Peret had been attacked by iwi purwa (‘elephant spirit wind’), [Page 120] which had observed a gap in his protective nika and had taken advantage of the situation. Peret eventually recovered after a series of medicinal baths designed to eliminate the ‘elephant spirit wind’ from his system. If this hadn’t been done he would have gone crazy and died."
t0421 cite0075 SB05 "Some unlucky individuals are born with an inherent vulnerability to the attacks of specific ponikana, a condition which is called ‘bead necklace’ ( wintup). The bead necklace may be thought of as a spiritual “brand” which is placed around the neck of the fetus in the womb. 11 It is believed that during gestation the spirit of the fetus lives in the house of Muu on the forth level of the cosmos. Muu’s house is also crowded with all manner of spiritual animals, and if the pregnant woman (or one of her close relatives) offends a particular flesh-and-blood animal during gestation, the spirtual counterpart of that animal will either thwart birth, endow the fetus with some of its physical or behavioral characteristics, or leave its mark in the form of the bead necklace. This mark singles the child out for easy attack by the poni in question unless it is discerned early and ‘broken’ by means of special medicines. When a child is born, midwives always search for evidence of a bead necklace, which cannot, of course, be seen in that form. If the umbilical cord is coiled like a snake, the child may have a snake poni bead necklace; if the child is born crouched like a jaguar, the [Page 121] jaguar poni has most likely left his mark; and so forth. Sometimes the bead necklace is not discerned at birth, and it is only after a person has a series of a close brushes with a particular kind of animal or spirit that the nature of his affliction is inferred."
t0421 cite0075 SB05 "11 Bead necklaces are common symbols in Kuna medical beliefs. It was noted earlier in this chapter that kiatakkalet spirits often place sickness necklaces around their victim’s necks. Ponikana often use this technique; and the curing spirits marshalled by the curing specialists frequently place necklaces on ponikana to subdue them."
t0422 cite0075 SB05 "Curing specialists are highly vulnerable to the attacks of ponikana because their dealings with them are typically prolonged and intimate. Although their knowledge of the spirits and the workings of the spirit realm usually serves to protect them from mishaps, occasional mistakes or indiscretions can bring on disaster. Specialists who overstep their capabilities and attempt to do too much with limited knowledge are inviting misfortune. For example, one man from Cartí tried to learn ‘The Way of Muu’ ( Muu Ikar), one of the most powerful of Kuna curing [Page 124] chants, before he was old enough; 14 he was overcome by Muu, who caused him to vomit blood, and he died shortly thereafter. Occasionally, men who work with ‘demon medicine’ ( nia ina) or with the chant called ‘The Way of the Demon’ ( Nia Ikar), are attacked by demons when they reach old age and their nika is on the wane. Other specialists who let their own spirits travel too freely among the ponikana to learn chants and medicines become contaminated by the company they keep."
t0422 cite0075 SB05 "14 Most specialists say that to learn ‘The Way of Muu’ one must already be a grandfather."
t0422 cite0075 SB05 "When important curing ceremonies are undertaken, both the specialist in charge and the patient -- and, in some cases, everyone who participates -- are expected to observe the rules surrounding the ceremony with care. Failure to do so displays a blatant disrespect for the curing spirits enlisted as helpers, and when such transgressions are committed the spirits are likely to take offense and retaliate. Some breaches of etiquette are minor, and the curing spirits will simiply refuse to cooperate, thus rendering the ceremony ineffective. But more flagrant transgressions will often send them against the participants in a fury. One of the most serious of these violations occurs when the specialist or the patient engages [Page 125] in sex during the course of the ceremony. 15 This point is well illustrated in the ritual called Nek Apsoket (‘Conversing with the Place’), which is performed to exorcise large numbers of ponikana that have attacked the entire community. During this eight-day ceremony, no one in the village may engage in sex (or even have close contact with members of the opposite sex), and to stress this rule, men and women eat and sleep apart. In this case, it is the leaders of the ceremony who stand to be punished for the sexual transgression of any village members, and the result is often death. One specialist in the region of Niatuppu, to the West of Ustuppu, suffered a massive nose bleed and died because someone in the village committed an indiscretion (Howe: personal communication, 1976). And several years ago, a famous Apsoket chanter from Ustuppu reportedly succumbed to the very same ponikana he was attempting to exorcise when his spirit helpers, offended by the sexual behavior of two participants, stopped protecting him. 16"
t0422 cite0075 SB05 "15 The specialist must abstain from sex the night before the ceremony begins, and continue until it is finished. The Kuna say the the spirits of most medicines are women. They stand about the hammock of the patient, protecting him from ponlkana and administering his medicines. When the medicine spirits are engaged in such activities, they will brook no competition for the affections of either the specialist or the patient. It is clear, however, that no curing spirits, male or female, tolerate sex during curing ceremonies."
t0422 cite0075 SB05 "16 This particular ceremony was performed to combat an epidemic of fever (diagnosed as malaria by the doctor from the Ailikanti hospital) in the village of Kalet, on the mainland near the Colombian border. The doctor himself, who was given reluctant entrance by villagers, also fell ill."
t0423 cite0075 SB05 "Certain animals are considered especially dangerous, and for this reason contact with them should be kept to a minimum or avoided altogether. The rattlesnake ( ukkunaipe) is said to be the friend of the Kuna, and should not be harmed, for its spirit is employed by snake medicine specialists to procure medicines to combat snake ponikana. But if someone foolishly kills a rattlesnake, it has the ability to send its purpa (which is frequently clothed in substance) to attack its killer. 17 A snake hawk called wekko, 18 if wounded, will call to all the snakes in the jungle to pursue and bite the hunter. Simply seeing a coral snake ( masarnaipe) will bring on the death of someone in the viewer’s immediate family. Such disagreeable animals as crocodiles, large sharks, and octopuses are quick to launch spirit attacks if they are touched or disturbed. 19 Similarly, sloths and tree anteaters should not be touched or killed, as they are likely to launch spiritual attacks and bring on weaknesses. Certain types of red animals, most of them birds, should be left alone, for they cause complications involving bleeding. Ritual specialists may confront these animals directly or even kill them for use as medicines; but [Page 127] this can be done only because the specialists know the “secrets” ( purpa, wilup) of the animals and their knowledge gives them power over their spirits. 20"
t0423 cite0075 SB05 "20 These “secrets” are short, spoken “origin histories” such as the one for genipa mentioned in the last chapter. They tell the spirits that the specialist knows all about them, and thus demonstrate that has them in his power. The Kuna often label these “origin histories” with the Spanish term “Secreto.”"
t0424 cite0075 SB05 "When epidemics of diarrhea, fever, pustules, and skin disease sweep through Kuna communities, it is believed that groups of ponikana have become angry with the entire population because one or more persons have violated their sanctuary. 22 There are poni sanctuaries everywhere -- in swamps, in thick stretches of jungle, in pools alongside the islands -- that are well-known to virtually all Kuna adults. Certain regions on the mainland are strictly excluded from farming activities (although medicines may be gathered at these places freely and without danger) for fear of molesting the spirits. Certain large trees belong to specific groups of ponikana, who stretch their clotheslines among the branches. 23 If these trees are chopped down, the ponikana become furious, and forthwith invade the community of the man who has offended them. Sometimes the violation of a poni sancturay is done unwittingly, as occured when an individual living on Ustuppu dug deep holes for the foundation of a cement house and impinged on the territory of a group of ponikana living under the ground. Most poni [Page 129] sanctuaries, however, are well known to village members, and are disturbed only by people who lack experience or who refuse to be cautious. A few years ago, a man from Ustuppu mistakenly (so he claimed) burned down a tree belonging to a band of snake ponikana while clearing a plot for a corn farm. Several days later, a young man was fatally bitten by a snake as he was working on a nearby communal farm. During the next week, people spotted snakes throughout the mainland and a couple of the creatures even appeared on the island. The snakes, it was concluded, had broken loose from their home and were venting their fury on the entire community."
t0424 cite0075 SB05 "22 The pustules are symptoms of smallpox, which until recently was commom in San Blas. The spirit which causes it is called ai sapet (‘loving friend’), for he jumps from one person to the next. When ‘loving friend’ attacks, the community is sealed off and no one is allowed to leave or arrive from other communities."
t0424 cite0075 SB05 "23 For someone who wants to chop down one of these trees there is a chant called Mortup Okwaet Ikar (‘The Way of Changing the Clothes-lines’). The specialist who performs this chant changes the clothes-lines to another tree and placates the spirits."
t0425 cite0075 SB05 "The nele (‘seer,’ ‘shaman’; plural form: nerkan or nelekana) enjoys a unique status in Kuna society and stands apart from all other ritual specialists by virtue of his possession of supernatural powers. The nele has the ability to send his purpa on journeys into the world of spirit and to communicate freely with its inhabitants. He is also recognized as the master diagnostician of illness, for he is equipped [Page 138] with a supernatural ‘lens’ ( ispe) which enables him to peer directly into the spiritual makeup of his fellow men. The nele is distinguished further from other specialists on the gronds that his abilities are held to be innate, having been formed by Muu inside his mother’s womb. 6 All other ritual professions can be learned by anyone with the capacity and disposition for study, but only those born with what is termed a nele kurkin are allowed to pursue careers as nerkan. 7 Women may also be nerkan, and this is the only profession within the field of curing, aside from that of midwife, that they can hold. 8"
t0425 cite0075 SB05 "6 Muu forms the personality of humans in the womb by educating the spirit of the fetus. For this reason, everyone’s personality is in a sense innate. On the other hand, Muu does not teach chants or medicinal knowledge. All she does is create the appropriate disposition for such learning. Fetuses destined to be nerkana, however, are given their supernatural powers in the womb (although these powers must be developed more fully after birth)."
t0425 cite0075 SB05 "7 The kurkin is a spiritual entity which determines a person’s capacity or predisposition. See Chapter Six and the Glossary for a more thorough explanation of kurkin."
t0425 cite0075 SB05 "8 There are three nerkan presently living on Ustuppu, and all three are women. A few women fill ritual positions in the puberty ceremony, but this is not considered by the Kuna to be within the field of curing."
t0426 cite0075 SB05 "He (Pérez) was out in the forest and experienced a fright. Having returned to his hut he felt fever coming on, and the next day he was rather ill. Pérez did not know what kind of illness he was suffering from, and his people asked him to given an account of the dreams he had during the night. He then told them that he had dremt that he had revisited the place in the forest where had been the day before. His people then expressed the opinion that his purba had been ravished by some evil spirit. The fever increased, and each time he dropped off to sleep he dreamt of the same spot in the forest. His people then called in a person who, by means of the Spanish pepper chant, ( kaburr tulet 28 ), knew how to dispatch the protective spirits on their quest to rescue the ravished purba. (Nordenskiold 1938:335)."
t0426 cite0075 SB05 "28 Nordenskiold was confused. The name of this chant is Kapur Ikar (‘The Way of Spanish Pepper’); the specialist who knows this chant is referred to as kapur tulet (‘Spanish pepper man’)."
t0427 cite0075 SB05 "In cases of purpa abduction the intensity of fever is also an important element in diagnosis. Ponikana have domains on the surface of the (spiritual) earth, but they also maintain quarters on other levels of the cosmos to which they can travel at will. The deeper ponikana journey into the levels with the stolen purpa, the more serious the condition of the patient becomes. Generally, the mildest fever indicates that the ponikana still have the purpa hostage on the surface; as the fever grows in intensity, the specialists assume that the ponikana are retreating down through the levels. 31 Information as to the depth to which the ponikana have taken the purpa is of vital importance, for the curer must know where to send his spiritual helpers to retrieve it. Although it may be known, for example, that crocodile ponikana residing at the mouth of a particular river are responsible, a search on the surface would be futile if in fact the purpa has been taken to the second [Page 164] level. Thus, complete diagnosis in cases of purpa abduction entails not only the identity of the thieving ponikana (which depends primarily on the patient’s recent actions), but also knowledge of the level on which the ponikana are holding the purpa (which is based on the intensity of the symptoms)."
t0427 cite0075 SB05 "31 There is difference of opinion on this matter among specialists in Ustuppu and Okop Sukkun. Some begin their search for the purpa on the third level, no matter what the intensity of the fever. They do not even look on the surface. A number of other specialists, however, claim that if the purpa is taken as far as the third level, it cannot be recovered and the patient will die."
t0428 cite0075 SB05 "In summary, diagnosis is a complex process of inference which sifts through available evidence and attempts to establish the identity of the poni or ponikana which have caused the [Page 167] illness in question. At times, diagnosis is simple and the treatment based upon it is successful. This demonstrates to the Kuna conclusively that the diagnosis was correct. Occasionally, however, the evidence is less clear, and the Kuna are left with several competing interpretations. The most desirable strategy at this point is to enlist the aid of a nele (seer), who possesses the power to scan the purpa of the victim and view the problem directly. But even the nele may err, and when the patient fails to respond to treatment, new attempts at diagnosis must be undertaken. When a range of possibilities exists, several different hypothesis are occasionally maintained and used as a basis for treatment."
t0428 cite0075 SB05 "An example of this occurred two years ago in Ustuppu. A well-known medicine man was violently stricken by a poni which produced a corroding skin rash over much of his body, nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, and a drastic loss of weight. He was restricted to his hammock and within two weeks he was reduced to skin and bones. As his condition grew more severe, three alternate diagnoses were proposed, and all of them were kept alive as working hypothesis. It was first seen as significant that the medicine man had fallen ill within a week of performing a ceremony to ‘cool the purpa’ ( purpa ottammimakket) of a four year-old girl. During the ceremony, which lasted four days and demanded the participation of the girl’s family members, a group of children had been allowed to run about, joke loudly among themselves, and generally raise [Page 168] havoc. It was believed that the spirits of the medicines used during the ceremony may have become offended by this lack of discipline and had turned in retaliation on the chanter. The second hypothesis proceeded from the fact that the patient had been actively involved in the revolution of 1925. Because he had seen Panamanian national guardsmen killed, the ‘assassin’ poni had infected him, and now, years later, it had begun to ravage his spirit. The final hypothesis centered on the fact that the patient was adept with nia medicine. Because this profession brings the specialist into intimate contact with the powerful nia spirits, it is highly dangerous. While the medicine man was usually protected by his knowledge of medicines, somehow his guard had dropped -- perhaps because he was old and his nika was low -- and a nia was attacking his purpa."
t0429 cite0075 SB05 "Two skills are given particularly high value among Kuna ritual specialists: a thorough knowledge of the features of the [Page 190] spirit world, and an ability to articulate this knowledge in a coherent, comprehensive, and pleasing manner. The Kuna believe that in order to control the course of events in the world of spirit -- and, consequently, in the world of substance -- one must be able to tell the spirits about themselves. A specialist must demonstrate to the spirits that he knows who they are, how they came into being, what their physical and behavioral characteristics are, where they live, and what their names are. Such information comprises what is called the purpa. In this context, the word purpa means something more than ‘spirit’ or ‘soul’. It refers to the underlying essence of things, the most fundamental facts of existence. And only by knowing the purpa of something can one control it."
t0429 cite0075 SB05 "The word purpa also labels a genre of short “origin histories” which describe the birth of various important spirits from the womb of the Great Mother. 18 For reasons no one could explain to me, these origin histories are in colloquial Kuna, not the language of the spirit world. Their content is blatantly sexual, and because they are perfectly intelligible to non-specialists they are closely guarded by the specialist who [Page 191] know them. 19 Origin histories are not chanted, but rather an spoken softly or merely thought through in the presence of the spirits (see Nordenskiold 1938:346). In theory, all things have purpa histories, for all things were born from the Great Mother at the time of creation. In actual fact, however, only a handful of purpa histories of ‘principal’ spirits are known and used by Kuna specialists. Some of these deal with the origins of powerful medicinal spirits such as genipa, balsawood, Spanish pepper, cacao, and ‘grandmother string’ ( muutup); 20 others involve prominent inhabitants of the world of spirit such as Muu and Uncle Kwetuli (see discussion of Apsoket Ikar in Chapter Seven). There are also purpa histories for things such as snakes, centipedes, wasps, scorpions, and bars of incandescent steel."
t0429 cite0075 SB05 "19 Sexual matters are never discussed publically. While I was doing fieldwork, several teenage boys discovered some of these origin histories written in a specialist’s notebook. They were caught reading them to their friends, some of whom were girls. The culprits were severely punished, and the book was locked up."
t0430 cite0075 SB05 "Before describing the three qualitative classes of medicine in greater detail, a few words should be said about Kuna botany. Most accomplished specialists have an extensive knowledge of the botanical resources which surround them. Much of this knowledge deals with “natural” family groupings of plants, which serve to guide medicine men in selecting medicines. However, as will be seen, the selection of medicines is frequently based on entirely different considerations."
t0430 cite0075 SB05 "The Kuna divide the plant kingdom into three general classes: ‘trees’ ( sappiwalakan), ‘vines’ ( tupakan), and ‘small plants and bushes’ ( kakan or purkan). Those versed in ritual history explain that during the creation the Great Mother and the Great Father came together to give birth to all of the plants and place them or earth. They did this ‘in lines’ ( ile ile), which is to say that they placed them in orderly fashion, one after the other, family by family. There is a good deal of confusion among different specialists as to what the precise order of creation was, but the composition of the individual family groups is generally agreed upon. Thus, the original couple sent all of the trees with hard hearts in a group. one after the other, and they represent a single family. Similarly, [Page 225] all of the black palms with spines came together, as did the trees with abundant white sap, the trees with foul-smelling bark, the trees with spines, the bitter trees, the foul-smelling vines, the vines with spines, the bitter vines, the plants which yield red coloring, a group of small plants which grow along the river banks, the sweet-smelling plants, the chile peppers, and so forth."
t0430 cite0075 SB05 "Membership in a particular family group is based on the presence or absence of one or more shared attributes, such as degree of hardness, color, possession of spines, smell, and taste. These attributes are closely related to function. Thus, trees with hard hearts are used as posts for house construction and as medicine for making the nika strong. The black palms with spines are employed in house construction, for making fishing spears, bows and arrow tips; as medicines they are used to strengthen nika, to combat ponikana which cause sharp jabbing pains, and to aid in recovering abducted purpakana. The chile peppers are used as condiments with meals, and as medicines to ‘confuse the road’ that ponikana take to the purpa. When the attributes of two or more different family groups are similar, the families are seen as distinct yet closely related, for they perform the same medicinal functions. Thus, although foul-smelling vines and trees are obviously different in a botanical sense, they are considered functionally equivalent. Both serve to confuse the road taken by ponikana, and are therefore often mixed together in a single medical preparation."
t0430 cite0075 SB05 "Skilled medicine men have a thorough knowledge of the different plant families and their functional attributes. Such knowledge is essential in organizing medical treatments, for there is often a correspondence between “natural” botanical categories and their medicinal counterparts. The following examples, taken from the notebooks of several medicine men on Ustuppu, illustrate this point: 8"
t0430 cite0075 SB05 "8 I did not identify most of these plants according to the Western botanical scheme, and therefore leave them with Kuna names. It is sufficient here merely to note the criterial attributes of the family groups as seen by the Kuna."
t0431 cite0075 SB05 "As with the dangerous animal medicines, preparations involving sappi karta and muutup sometimes produce unintended results of a disastrous nature. For example, a number of years ago in the Cartí region, a man treated himself with sappi karta in order to learn curing chants. While sleeping at night, his purpa travelled to a region of the spirit world and undertook a study of chants under the direction fo the sappi karta spirit. Before long, the man from Cartí was afflicted with a series of splitting headaches, and although he discontinued treatment he had by this time become Kiatakkalet. Since this misfortune, he has been accused of trying to kill villagers in their dreams on no fewer than four different occasions, and while he is presently a highly respected curing specialist, his reputation as kiatakkalet is widely known."
t0432 cite0075 SB05 "All of the dangerous medicines, animal and non-animal alike, are used either to acquire behavioral traits which carry prestige or to force an individual to act contrary to his will. Thus, a man skilled in chanting or public speaking stands out as a superior member of the community, as does a particularly adept hunter or fisherman. And while medical preparations used to attract others are sometimes justifiable -- as when, for example, a mother wants her son to return from an extended stay in Panama City -- the motivation lurking behind this type of medicine is typically tinged with selfishness. By contrast, non-dangerous medicines do not confer qualities which bring prestige to the user; neither do they impinge on the lives of others. For example, among those animal medicines which are not considered dangerous, leaf-cutter ant medicine transforms the user into a strong, diligent worker. These are qualities which are expected of all Kuna men, not those which are restricted to a select few. By the same token, women who ingest hummingbird ashes and green moray eel meat during pregnancy are not [Page 244] interested in gaining prestige; they are simply taking sensible steps to avoid complications during childbirth."
t0433 cite0075 SB05 "In colloquial Kuna the word kurkin means ‘hat.’ In the language of the spirits, however, its meaning is less easy to define. The term is sometimes used to refer to a spiritual hat resting on the head of a particular spirit, a magical hat that stands for the special knowledge and power possessed by its owner. 72 However, the most prominent meaning of kurkin pertains to the intellectual and creative capacity of an individual, and in this sense it designates his “spiritual brain.” 73 At the same time, kurkin may refer to a person’s personality, any special aptitudes he may have, or to his unique bent of mind. Everyone has a kurkin, and it is said of those who have learned several prestige skills that they have multiple [Page 297] kurkin. For example, skilled chanters have kurkin for chanting; and those who have established reputations as public speakers, hunters, canoe makers, artists or medicine men also have kurkin for their respective specialities. A person’s kurkin also determines the contours of his personality. Someone who is stingy, irascible, or quarrelsome is said to have a defective kurkin. 74"
t0433 cite0075 SB05 "72 In a number of curing chants the spirit helpers of the chanters are described as wearing eight hats. They also wear eight coats, eight vests, eight pairs of shoes, eight pairs of pants, etc. (as these clothes are spiritual, there is no problem in putting them on; of course, eight pairs of substantial shoes would cause greater difficulties). The hats, along with the other articles of clothing, point to the fact that the spirit helpers are formidably powerful characters."
t0433 cite0075 SB05 "73 The kurkin is not a spiritual counterpart of the substantial brain. The substantial brain is called nono sakwar."
t0433 cite0075 SB05 "74 There is another metaphorical meaning of kurkin which isn’t easily explained. When a woman is pregnant it is said that she ‘has a kurkin’ ( kurkin nikka). This expression is used to disguise her condition from young people, who shouldn’t know about such things."
t0433 cite0075 SB05 "The kurkin of human beings is initally formed by Muu and her daughters inside the womb, and is therefore innate. 75 However, while a person’s mental abilities and character are to some extent determined at birth, his kurkin can be modified during the course of his life. The parents of children born with a kurkin marking them as nerkan (seers) occasionally administer medicines to nullify this ability; and medicines are used to cancel the characteristics of a kurkin which makes the owner vulnerable to attacks by certain kinds of wild animals and [Page 298] ponikana. 76 By the same token, the kurkin may be damaged by ponikana which launch attacks and bring on headaches, bad dreams, and mental disorders; and people occasionally bring misfortune upon themselves through the irresponsible use of dangerous medicines. In such cases, the kurkin is often corrupted beyond redemption, leaving the user kiatakkalet, suicidal, or half-witted. 77 On the other hand, the kurkin may be improved through the proper use of medicines. The purpose of kurkin medicine is not to make the user more knowledgeable, but rather to develop his abilities for learning. Specific qualities of the medicines are added to the kurkin so that the patient is able to increase his capacity for learning particular specialities."
t0433 cite0075 SB05 "75 In some of the curing chants ( Kurkin Ikar, Muu Ikar) there are descriptions of Muu and her daughters instructing the spirits of fetuses (‘her children’) to write on pieces of paper. These are their kurkin, which are being developed."
t0433 cite0075 SB05 "Many of the school-age boys suffer from headaches and poor concentration in the face of rigorous study. The Kuna say that their kurkin is simply too small to incorporate all the new things they are learning, and it needs to be ‘enlarged’ ( otummoe) and ‘opened up” ( onape, ekae). The pain they experience is caused by an abundance of knowledge pushing against the walls of the kurkin; and their inability to concentrate is produced when the kurkin is ‘rising up’ ( ainakkwe), a condition which causes light-headedness. When this occurs, a medicine man skilled in kurkin medicine is approached, and arrangements are made as to when, where, and how treatment should be carried out. The medicine man then collects a varied assortment of plants, prepares them, and informs them [Page 301] of the patient’s difficulties and the manner in which they should work to set things right. Kurkin treatments call for a wide spectrum of medicines, for several tasks must be accomplished."
t0434 cite0075 SB05 "Two highly structured treatments are those used to cure snake-bite and to enhance intellectual capacity. When a person is bitten by a snake, a crisis situation develops in which both the patient and the entire village become vulnerable to further attack by snake ponikana. Treatments for increasing intelligence, on the other hand, pose no threat to the community. These are private affairs involving the patient and the specialist, but at the same time they must be closely controlled in order to be effective."
t0435 cite0075 SB05 "Many Kuna medical specialists formerly had small houses constructed in their patios expressly for administering lengthy treatments, but these are rare in Ustuppu and Okop Sukkun today. 79 At present, a person taking kurkin medicine with the aim of increasing his intellectual capacity usually stays in the house of a specialist for the duration of treatment. 80 During this time, the patient is not permitted to leave the premises except to relieve himself. A hammock is strung for him at a quiet end of the house next to a small enclosure covered with leaves and/or pieces of cloth (Figure 21). Inside the enclosure, there is an undersized canoe containing medicinal plants soaking in water, and off to the side are several pots and buckets filled with similar preparations."
t0435 cite0075 SB05 "79 According to Nordenskiold (1938:364-5), “it is not advantageous to be exposed to the smoke from the fireplaces when one is taking medicinal baths. Therefore Nele (Kantule) is considering the idea of building a special bath house on the nearby uninhabited mainland for the schoolboys of Ustuppu, where each and every one can have his own bathtub can can bathe in medicine which makes it easier for him to learn to read and write.” This was evidently never done."
t0435 cite0075 SB05 "80 Kurkin medicine may also be given in the home of the patient, but this is not common. One young man told me that he had once taken a kurkin treatment in his own home, and later another in the home of a specialist. Although the same medicine man engineered both treatments, the patient claimed that the one undertaken in the specialist’s home was by far the most effective."
t0435 cite0075 SB05 "In the process of re-forming a kurkin, strict controls are placed on the patient’s behavior and on the types of food he may eat, for his new spiritual kurkin is believed to be like soft tissue, very delicate, and easily damaged. All of his food, which is sent from his house, is carried either by pre-pubescent girls or women past the reproductive age, and contact with teenage girls and young women is absolutely forbidden. The Kuna say that the spirits of the medicines, which are women, stand guard over the patient and help him bathe when he sits down in the medicine canoe. 82 Competition for [Page 305] the patient’s affections with mortal women of reproductive age would make them jealous, and when this occurs, they often refuse to work for him and the medicines do not function. 83"
t0435 cite0075 SB05 "82 During a kurkin treatment, a boy once dreamed that he saw several strange women standing at the foot of has hammock. When he related this to the specialist, he was told that these were the spirits of the medicine."
t0435 cite0075 SB05 "83 For this reason, no medicine man may engage in sexual intercourse when he is handling a treatment. Of course, he may associate with women much more freely than the patient."
t0436 cite0075 SB05 "Years ago, ritual specialists never expected monetary remuneration for their services. Instead, they were accorded special status in the community, and this was reward enough."
t0437 cite0075 SB05 "Shaman Sainakkaselepalele 5 has arrived; his body is growling ‘uurrr,’ his body is firm. Also present are Shaman Katturkkwalele (a tree), Shaman Kattepalele ( kattepwala 6 ), and Shaman Mummupalele ( mummutwala; ‘drunktree’). When the flowers of Shaman Drunktree are blooming, he is wearing a red hat. Shaman Ukkurwalalele ( ukkurwala; balsawood) has arrived from the direction of the rising sun. He was given life by Tiolele at the beginning of time. When men have lost their purpakana they go to him for help. The chanter tells Shaman Balsawood how the men cut his body with their small, well-sharpened knives: they are carving Shaman Balsawood, they are cutting away chunks to from the arms and legs. They throw the chips on the ground, the ground is becoming white. Shaman Balsawood looks just like Kuna men as he is being carved. Long ago Tiolele (Great Father) placed Shaman Balsawood on the earth so Kuna men could use him to recover their abducted purpakana."
t0437 cite0075 SB05 "5 The specialist who performed this chant did not know what this plant was. As the chants have been passed down from the epoch in which the Kuna lived on the mainland, miles from their present location in San Blas, some of the plants have never been seen by the chanters."
t0438 cite0076 SB05 "“McKim has given an excellent statement of their status: ‘ Neles are not eminent through chance or any spell of the mysterious. People do not expect the impossible, but they do expect results in keeping with uncommon mentality. They are not venerated, and people frankly criticize failures. A Nele is on trial at all times, and his judgments are repeated freely. The Cuna respects merit, and merit is the greatest homage he pays; but merit must be demonstrated.”’"
t0438 cite0076 SB05 "“The Nele cannot cure himself or members of his own family. Some are said to have developed such tricks of the trade as being able to grasp a red-hot iron, or walk on burning coals; but this is not usual. Their ability lies primarily in their knowledge of esoteric lore, and the supposed ability to communicate with the spirit world at will. They are the recognized experts on spiritual matters. Present day Neles are said to be less powerful than the Neles of the recent past, who are said to have been able to cut down trees by ‘mental projection’ only.”"
t0438 cite0076 SB05 "“The Innatuledi are the true medical practitioners of the Cuna. There are many in each community, perhaps one for each twenty or thirty people--even on the most acculturated islands. None of them claims to know all of the various chants, and the medicines which accompany them. In the event of an illness which they cannot diagnose, they consult other Innatuledis or a Nele. The childbirth medicines are the most important, and the first to be learned. Medicines are primarily learned from teachers, never on vision guests; though some are said to be learned in dreams. Most of the curing depends on nominalism in the chants, and the use of imitative medicines. There is a distinct recognition of the need of sick persons for quiet, coolness, and soothing; and some of the many medicines do appear to have healing virtues. These [197] are discussed in more detail under Curing Systems. One of the prime requisites of these curers is the knowledge of thousands of jungle plants, used in the curing rites. Some of these curers had Perez bring back seeds from Sweden to plant in their gardens. Deer horns are highly valued, and the Innatuledi will pay up to three dollars for a pair which the ordinary Cuna would pay twenty cents for use as a hat rack.”"
t0438 cite0076 SB05 "“Only three Absogedis are at present practicing among the Cuna. They are curers who assume the responsibility for checking disease of epidemic proportions, and are called in to protect entire villages. They charge very high fees, both for actual curing ceremonies and to instruct pupils. They are also the only teachers who can properly instruct a Nele. It is the Absogedi’s magic which protects the Nele’s soul when he sends it to the world of evil spirits to make friends. The village curing ceremonies require knowledge of a chant which requires eight days to sing through. Adjuncts such as the life size figures are used, and their Purba sent in search of the demon afflicting the village.”"
t0438 cite0076 SB05 "“There are many men who only specialize in one or two curing rites, such as headache chanters, snake bite doctors, and fever chanters. The kantules officiate at the puberty ceremonies, and the Masartuledi are the death chanters.”"
t0438 cite0076 SB05 "“There are evil sorcerers, who are at times killed. They are regarded as Neles or other shamans whose kurgin has been spoiled by too much medicine. Usually cured by other medicines, they are recognized through someone’s dream experiences, or through having given a false diagnosis. Wassén (1949, p. 49) states that legendary history lists several female sorcerers.”"
t0439 cite0077 SB05 "Different medicine men can be specialists in different evil spirits. It is obvious that there is no single Indian who knows all medicines, evil spirits, sagas, traditions, and so forth. When I, together with Pérez [the informant], went through the notes made by Slater from the dictation of an absogedi in Ailigandi, it was clear that there was much that was new to him. In these notes one gets a great deal of information about where the protective spirits come from, of which Pérez had not previously wished, or been able, to give any indication. This naturally does not prevent Pérez’ comments on these notes from being very worthwhile, as they are, for the most part, about things with which he was already familiar."
t0439 cite0077 SB05 "To ask a Cuna Indian, for example, »Do you believe that a human being has a soul?» is absolutely naive. The question cannot be answered with yes or no. We find in the chapter on the soul, purba, the description of a complicated concept. The answer to a question when it is a matter of ideology is to be taken with caution. It is another matter if the question leads to Pérez’ telling what he has done himself in this or that circumstance."
t0439 cite0077 SB05 "When one discusses anything with Pérez one understands how knowledge is distributed among a few individuals in the Cuna community, and not in such a way that one can know everything. Nele knows the most but his knowledge embraces more than anything else the traditions and medicines. On the other hand he does not understand, for example, picture-writing. Absogedis’ knowledge is also [Page xviii] limited to a certain field. Nele knows the absogedi-song also. Certain persons know only certain songs."
t0439 cite0077 SB05 "When we study the Cuna Indians’ concepts we must distinguish between the great mass of beliefs and what the Great Seer Nele and the thinking people believe. The Cunas have thus a great many sagas of the usual type such as the story of how they got fire, and the story of the world tree, in which animals take part, speak and behave like people. For Nele and the thinking Indians these stories do not belong to any special field of knowledge, but are more or less known by all the Indians and have no further significance. They don’t believe as the great masses that these mythic Heroes in the shape of animals have actually existed. It is first with Ibeorgun and his followers that this tradition begins as the real history of this people. Ibeorgun does not change himself into an animal and he never does anything which is supernatural. He and his followers are reformers and inventors who build up the Cuna culture, concoct medicines, improve the language, introduce the puberty feasts, and so on. The only supernatural thing which is told about Ibeorgun and the earlier mythie Heroes of this type is that they have come down from heaven and that they have no earthly father or mother."
t0439 cite0077 SB05 "The Cunas have beautiful stories, rich in imagination, which tell about the wandering of the human soul after death to the kingdom of the dead. Even these are for Nele only stories which he tells to the common Indians, in order to have them believe in them and have their morals built up by them, but he himself does not believe them. Regarding the fate of the soul after death Nele has himself only a vague idea. He confesses to the specially initiated that he doesn’t know where the human souls go when they die. »Nobody knows the soul’s fate after death», Nele has said. ..."
t0439 cite0077 SB05 "All the Cunas believe that animals, plants and stones, as well as people, carry out actions as if they had souls, but it is only a few [Page xx] who have tried to explain to themselves how that can be. Most of them content themselves with the superficial facts and don’t think of the reasons. When one who is eager to learn wants an explanation, he turns in most cases to Nele, who evidently has thought over the problems and who is the main one to carry on the traditions. It is purba that people, plants and animals and certain stones have, but it would not be correct to translate purba merely as soul. The dead person is nagiba, but nagiba is not identical with purba although it is purba, or more correctly purbagana (plural), which has made nagiba. But more of that later on. Here I have only wished to point out the difference between the ideas of those initiated in religious wisdom and the ideas of the great masses, between those who think and those who simply do what everyone else does."
t0439 cite0077 SB05 "When we study a primitive people’s culture we should not deceive ourselves into thinking that they tell us everything just because they tell very much. Pérez could really not remember either his father’s or mother’s name. On the other hand, he could tell us what his great grandmother was called.»"
t0440 cite0078 SB05 "Olowitinappi (who died in 1975) was a respected ‘chief’s spokesman’ who knew Kuna tradition well. He always attended ‘gatherings’ and spoke occasionally, in a quiet, almost shy manner not typical of ‘gathering house’ speakers. But Olowitinappi’s great love and the realm of his greatest success was medicine and curing. He would often go to the mainland jungle twice a day in order to gather medicinal plants. And he knew a large number of very long curing chants. His knowledge of ‘the way of the basil,’ used for hunting effectiveness, was one of the reasons he was such an excellent hunter. It is not surprising that his reputation was above all that of a ‘medicinal specialist’ and ‘ ikar knower.’ In 1970, Olowitinappi was sent at community expense to an interior jungle village in order to study snake-bite medicine and curing. Manuel Campos (who died in 1974) was a typical curing specialist. He rarely attended ‘gatherings’ and spoke there even more rarely. He much preferred to spend his evenings practicing one of the many chants he knew from memory or one he was still in the process of learning. He would boom these out into the night for family and neighbors all to hear, in addition of course to whatever spirits might be listening."
t0441 cite0078 SB05 "When a Kuna woman, man, or child is ill, a member of the family is sent to a nele (seer), who decides what the cause of the sickness is and what cure is needed. Through her or his ability to communicate with the spirits, the ‘seer’ is able to determine what the patient’s problem is. If the cure involves actual medicine, this medicine must be acquired from an inatulet (medicinal specialist), who also serves as a diagnostician in the absence of a ‘seer.’ The ‘medicinal specialist’ gathers plants of medicinal value from the nearby jungle. Before giving these plants to the patient’s family, he counsels them in order to activate them and give them life; that is, he transforms the plants into usable medicine. This activation process is carried out by directly addressing the spirits of the plants and telling them what they need to know in order to carry out their work."
t0441 cite0078 SB05 "In addition to the administration of physical medicine, curing, especially of serious diseases, often involves the performance of appropriate ikarkana. An ikar is performed by an ‘ ikar knower’ for the benefit of the sick person but addressed directly to the spirit world, in the form of a box of suar nuchukana (stick dolls), the representatives of the spirits of good, whose role it is to counter the evil spirits causing the disease. The sick person lies in a hammock in his or her house, and the ‘ ikar knower’ sits alongside on a bench. Under the hammock is the box of ‘stick dolls,’ as well as a pot of burning hot peppers and burning hot cacao, also used to fight off disease."
t0441 cite0078 SB05 "The ‘ ikar knower’ makes no physical gestures during the performance. He stares vaguely into space and, from time to time, smokes tobacco in his pipe. Others in the house either go about their usual business or sit beside the sick person and the ‘ ikar knower.’ The ‘ ikar knower’ performs the long (typically one hour or more) ikar in the late afternoon or early evening, after he has finished his other work for the day; he then leaves the house of the patient. He carries his walking stick and wears beads, signs of his role, and sometimes a tie. Performance of a curing ikar is usually repeated on four successive days."
t0442 cite0078 SB05 "Intimately related to the curing and prevention of disease is ina uanaet (medicine counsel), a set of ikarkana used to advise and counsel various types of medicine in order to activate them and render them effective. Certain objects in nature—for example, plants in the nearby mainland jungle—are inherently of medicinal value. 2 Nonetheless, in order to be effective, to be given life, these potential medicines must be told how to carry out their cure. This is precisely what occurs in ‘medicine counsel’ when the ‘medicinal specialist’ addresses the spirits of these plants directly. ‘Medicine counsel’ is performed in the jungle, at the moment of the cutting of the particular plant, and/or later on, in the home of the ‘medicinal specialist.’ The ‘medicinal specialist’ either sits or stands, with the medicine he is addressing placed directly in front of him. In addition to plants, such objects as pieces of glass, sticks, stones, phonograph needles, old shoes, or bars of soap can become medicinally effective if counseled. So while medicine is effective because of a combination of internal medicinal properties and power rendered through language, it is the verbal ‘counsel’ which is ultimately supreme, since without it nothing is effective and with it anything can become effective."
t0442 cite0078 SB05 "‘Medicine counsels’ are performed frequently and relatively publicly. They are typically performed by the ‘medicinal specialist’ when he returns from his morning’s work in the jungle. Many men have some knowledge of traditional medicine so that, even when they go to the jungle primarily for the purpose of farming or cutting wood, they often bring some medicine back with them. As a result, if you wander through a Kuna village at midday, through the bamboo walls of many houses you will hear the voices of men performing ‘medicine counsel’ to their just gathered medicine. These voices are often mingled with other voices and noises—the preparation of midday meals, children playing after their morning session at school, ordinary conversations, and radios."
t0442 cite0078 SB05 "There are various ‘medicine counsels,’ depending on what the medicine is to be used for and where it comes from. Muu ina uanaet (birth medicine counsel) advises medicine used in childbirth. Ina pukkip ikar (the way of much medicine), performed in the home of a sick person, counsels all the medicine in the jungle to come to the patient’s aid. Ina ulukanki (medicine in the trunks) counsels a whole medicinal laboratory; it is performed either in the home of the ‘medicinal specialist,’ in front of his collection of medicine, or in the home of a sick person. Ina tiikinet ikar (the way of the medicine in the water) counsels the medicine located at the bottom of a river."
t0443 cite0078 SB05 "A good example of variation and especially adaptation which functions to maintain tradition within the Kuna curing system is ‘medicine counsel.’ This set of ikarkana is used not only for traditional Kuna medicine but for any object or substance which is to be used as medicine. It is the ‘medicine counsel’ which renders the medicinal potential inherent in an object effective and gives it life, by explaining to it how to go about its work. This openness with regard to the class of medicine and its relationship to ‘medicine counsels’ makes it possible to accept and welcome non-Kuna, western medicine. From the Kuna point of view, it is quite possible for there to be medicine other than the plants that ‘medicinal specialists’ gather in the [Page 137] jungle; many objects are potentially medicinal. The skill of the ‘medicinal specialist’ consists not only in knowing what plants have medicinal value but in being able to counsel them and thus empower them. Similarly, the ikarkana used in the curing of disease are not in opposition to the medicine which is also used in the cure—they are complementary. The ikar advises the spirits of good to struggle against the spirits of evil. The ikar and the medicine work together. The more the patients have going for them, the better. So a cure can be effective by using Kuna medicine, Kuna ikarkana, and non-Kuna medicine, all at the same time. This is something which the Kuna understand perfectly well but outsiders have trouble grasping."
t0444 cite0079 SB05 "“The belief that individuals who repeatedly dream of the other sex are possessed and that tulekunedi, who appear with murderous intent in the dreams of others, should be killed by poisoning, clubbing, or burning (109) are undoubtedly aboriginal and perhaps are the same that Oviedo and Andagoya were describing when they wrote of persons possessed by an evil spirit. Though there are several accounts of such killings for the present century, the practice is now virtually discontinued. The discontinuance arises from a desire to be ‘civilized’; and replacing the killings are medicine cures recently developed by Chief Nele and other leading practitioners. Thus two Mandinga girls who several years ago repeatedly dreamed of meeting young men and whom the other villagers believed possessed and likely to bring danger to the whole community were successfully cured with medicines. On the other hand, the second chief at Rio Sidra early in 1940 convinced the inhabitants of his village that a man there was having dreams that were the result of possession and that unless he were killed the entire village was in danger. Consequently the man was burned to death, but the people of neighboring islands did not approve and for a time would have no traffic with the inhabitants of Rio Sidra.”"
t0445 cite0080 NV09 "Among the after-the-fact explanations one finds statements such as, “the patient is suffering from soul loss, his soul presently residing in the Owner of the Cave's soul pool.” [Page 119] Or, “the man is suffering from malaria which he got in hot country the last time he went to the fincas.” Or, “the man's spirit is being eaten by a witch, Mr. X, who is angry with him because he did not pay back the money he owed.” Every after-the-fact description of antecedent conditions implies a cause and effect relation such that the cause can be manipulated so as the patient will recover from the illness. After-the-fact descriptions of the sources of disease processes are never final since they are always dependent on (a) the further development of the disease process in the patient and (b) the confirmation in the identification of the source of illness by a successful attempt to reduce the effect of the source. If manipulation of the hypothesized source reduces the illness, the diagnosis of source is concluded to be correct; if not, further source potentials are searched for."
t0445 cite0080 NV09 "There is relatively little explicit procedural apparatus for adding to the inventory of after-the-fact explanations, and there are relatively few devices for modifying the modes of identification of the cause of the disease process. If a change capability is built into this theory of illness in Aguacatenango, it is not easy to detect wherein it lies."
t0445 cite0080 NV09 "The modes of change that we have observed in Aguacatenangueros' response to illness have involved shifts from known medical practitioners to others, where the theory remains relatively unexplicated and the results of the medical practitioner's progress are used to judge the probability of opting some particular medical practitioner for a cure rather than some other. Response to illness involves the principle of exhaustion of resources. In severe illness, the family of the patient may exhaust all known medical practitioners who are thought to have sufficient knowledge and skill and also may exhaust all means for motivating curers to come and perform the cure. With the diminution of resources and exhaustion of the most proper curers, the family of the patient explores curing sources whose potential for curing may be lower, but still appreciable. Successful curing under such circumstances raises the probability that this family will use some newly successful medical practitioner sooner in the next onset of illness, that is, he will be called upon before they have exhausted their resources. The introduction of INI medical practice into Aguacatenango has been in these terms, namely, that patients and their families have turned to INI medical personnel upon the exhaustion of their resources. INI procedures have maintained a ratio of successes over failures in these curing circumstances such that they have continued to be called upon, in some cases under less extreme conditions. The ratio of successes over failures has not been so great, however, that INI is seen to be a totally satisfactory replacement for the more well established practitioners. Furthermore, INI treats only a small proportion of the total range of “illnesses” that occur in the community. INI will increase the proportion of cases it treats as it modifies the Aguacatenangueros' perception of the success' failure ratio and as it increases the classes of illness that it deals with. It may be the case that INI has at present a maximal investment in time and resources in maintaining its present range and success proportion, so future severe changes may not be expected from them. There is, however, some generalization to other INI type of curers--namely, doctors in San Cristobal. The generalization here may increase the use of doctors over curers. There is the further possibility that curers are incorporating into their theories some of the simpler strategies used by doctors. This is done so crudely that it hardly involves change of beliefs at any detailed level, but rather involves a simple increase of the inventories of medicine by means of which the curer implements his theory."
t0446 cite0081 NU33 "Datura meteloides, Jimson weed, Jamestown weed.—This is another plant, though not of the ball cactus family, which makes a great impression on the mind of the Tarahumara. The well-known Datura, or Jimson weed, is greatly feared by the Indians, and they do not dare to touch the plant. Anyone who breaks it, or pulls it up, will go crazy and finally die! The plant is common in the upper river gorges and is often found in the caves where the Indians go to live in the winter. This presents a problem. However, most problems have their solution in Tarahumaraland, as elsewhere. The peyote shaman, armed as he is with the virtue of a plant stronger than Jimson, has the power to pull up these weeds and destroy them without ill effects. This is done with the usual peyote ceremonies, and hence creates another sphere of usefulness for the peyote specialist..."
t0446 cite0081 NU33 "The Mexicans call it by its Aztec name, toloachi; and the Tarahumaras call it dekúba . The Tarahumaras’ belief that children will go crazy if they play with the plant has a reason behind it. If a child eats the seeds, the effect can easily be fatal. The plant is used medicinally “for its very strong spirit.” Leaves are applied to the forehead to alleviate headaches, but must be removed soon after they are put there or the patient “may go crazy.” The peyote shaman is the only one who can remove the live plants which grow in the dwelling caves"
t0447 cite0082 NU33 "There are marked differences in some cases between the religious practitioner and the ordinary non-specialist in regard to their treatment of religious knowledge. This does not mean that there are two spheres of religious thought, the shaman’s and layman’s, but that the shaman can offer more elaborate and detailed descriptions or add so-called secret details to the same basic body of materials. This difference in treatment is illustrated in the accounts given by a shaman and by non-shamans of rusiwari, a dangerous object or entity which supposedly causes illness. A shaman from Norogachic gave the following account: [Page -110-]"
t0447 cite0082 NU33 "....I know by dreams that this rusiwari is not of this day. It is very ancient, from the ancient days,...from the days of the first people on earth. Because of this, the rusiwari are very dangerous to people and animals. These rusiwari do not like people because they are another kind of folk, very ancient, and different, and it is necessary to kill these rusiwari."
t0447 cite0082 NU33 "The rusiwari have a chief, the greatest one who commands the other rusiwari like a gobernador. The shaman must kill the chief. When I kill the chief the others leave because they have no leader. They are like a pueblo of rusiwari. I could not count them there are so many...."
t0447 cite0082 NU33 "Statements made by non-shamans concerning these rusiwari were varied and certainly not organized or explained in the above manner. While all agreed that a rusiwari was exceedingly dangerous and that it caused illness, there was no identification made with any ancient being. Most informants concentrated on its dangerous attributes, but as to its appearance there was no clear agreement. Some said that it was a smooth stone that scampered about in obscure corners of a room; others, that it flew about like a small bird, and still others, that it was a small carving in the form of an animal. All of them agreed, however, that the rusiwari was an agent of a sorcerer who used it against his enemies, and that it was highly mobile and visible only to the shaman, though it might be heard by anyone."
t0448 cite0082 NU33 "The Tarahumara believe that harm can be done in dreams not only by shamans, but by anyone. Therefore, the decline in numbers of skilled practitioners of sorcery does not mean that the belief in sorcery is no longer a factor in social behavior among the Tarahumara."
t0448 cite0082 NU33 "One of the most important concepts is that of sepawumera, the term for sorcery. In a literal sense, it means to ‘eat the heart.’ Since the heart is the seat of the soul, a threat to the heart is a direct and fatal one. The practice of sepawumera is directly linked to dreams, for it is through the medium of dreams that some types of sorcery are carried out. The soul is believed to leave the body in dreams and to wander about. Should the soul be prevented from reentering the body, the person will sicken and die. Whatever experiences happen to the animals or persons that appear in these dreams may be accepted as actual events. Should the dream event suggest violence, the person or animal damaged or wounded in the dream struggle is said to be ‘frightened.’ This ‘fright’ causes illness. Since the dream experience is given a high reality valuation, and since any person, thing, or animal may become implicated, there is in dreams a potential threat of aggression of which anyone, not just the trained practitioner, may be suspected. This point is of extreme importance for the understanding of certain conflict situations in interpersonal relations. Some dreams are projections of desired events, that is, wish fulfillments. Others are [Page 115] projections of dreaded events. The aggressions that are not permitted overt expression can rise to conscious levels in dreams. Since the dream experience can be treated as a very real occurrence, projected hostilities or fear of hostilities from others are given a form of reinforcement that can lead to conflict."
t0448 cite0082 NU33 "It is well known that some types of dreams are culturally patterned, that is, they are directly influenced by the cultural milieu in both form and content. In some cultures animals, plants, or spirits in animal guises converse with the dreamer, and confer power through suggested ritual; in others, the traveling motif such as the voyage over land masses or under the sea, is frequent; in still others, visits from deceased ancestors are received, and so on. It is necessary actually, to differentiate between these ‘stereotyped’ dreams which are repeated in most essential features by many members of the same group, and the equally stereotyped dreams which exploit certain key situations in the culture. Such dreams are induced (though unsought for) by the pressures of interpersonal relations. They are extremely valuable as guides to some of the tensions prevalent in the society. The first kind of stereotyped dream can be exploited by trained individuals for specific purposes. An example is the shaman who works through such dreams. The second type is not controlled by the dreamer, but occurs to him [Page 116] unbidden and serves the dreamer only as an unconscious mechanism of release from tension. Not only the anxieties caused by interpersonal relations, but also those fears that arise from the uncertainties of weather, which affect his animals and crops, are given expression. Drought, hail, insects and disease are a constant threat..."
t0448 cite0082 NU33 "In other such dreams the shaman talks to the souls of sick men and coaxes them to return to their bodies. He talks to the souls of oxen in order to make them work better. In dreams he discovers the location of lost objects."
t0448 cite0082 NU33 "The stereotyped dream of impending disaster is a common theme. An example of this is the dream of Juan Capochi from Choguita who dreamed that everyone in the pueblo was going to die of disease. [Page 117] He immediately notified the gobernador who, aware of the implications of such a dream, called all the people together and ordered them to make a fiesta, to kill two white oxen, and to dance the dutuburi . This type of dream involves the appearance of God and his verbal requests for a fiesta. Some disaster dreams involve such calamities as floods which wash away the pueblo, drowning everyone; or vast conflagrations caused by the sun descending close to the earth. In the rainy season, dreams of terrible hail storms that destroy all the crops occur."
t0448 cite0082 NU33 "The type of dream that is most directly indicative of strained interpersonal relations is recognized by the Tarahumara as a sorcery dream. When a Tarahumara has a dream that disturbs him so that he wakes with a feeling of anxiety, he calls the dream sepawumera. Some dreams supposedly directly implicate sorcerers (specialists). To dream of a rattlesnake is interpreted as an attempt upon che’s life by a sorcerer who tries to induce ‘fright.’ Dreams of rainbows and falling stars fall into this category. But the sort of dream that is most indicative of interpersonal tension is more situational in content rather than dependent upon such obvious symbols as a snake or falling star. Dreams of adultery on the part of one’s spouse, of being chased by a rival or enemy who has a knife or ax in hand, and dreams of desperate brawls fall into this class. It is believed [Page 118] that one is so frightened by these dreams that sickness results. Such sickness is then attributed to sorcery."
t0449 cite0083 NU33 "The Tarahumara consider illnesses to be of two types: those that afflict people's bodies and those that afflict their souls. The former usually are cured with plant or commercial medicines and increasingly are treated by physicians in Mexican government or Catholic facilities; the latter, which are usually produced by spirits, deities, or sorcerers, require the intervention of curing specialists who rely on their dreams to discover the causes of illness."
t0450 cite0084 NU33 "Three important categories of human beings also are omitted from the speeches. The first of these is sorcerers ( sukurúame ). 21 The Rarámuri of Rejogochi assume that both Indians and non-Indians and both men and women can become sorcerers, but they maintain that the majority of sorcerers as well as the most dangerous ones are Rarámuri men. These evil practitioners harm people in a number of ways. They (or rather their souls) travel during dreaming to capture the souls of their victims or they petition the Devil in their dreams to make their enemies sick. Sorcerers also dispatch the predatory animals they own—usually one of the evil birds called oromá, which are identified with shooting stars—to attack their victims. Once captured, the souls are held prisoner for a few days and then boiled and eaten by the sorcerers, often joined by their animal familiars and the Devil. When a soul is taken, the victim immediately becomes seriously ill and will die if a doctor cannot rescue the soul before it is destroyed. Children live only a day or so after their souls are stolen because they are not as “tough” ( biwárame ) as those of adults."
t0450 cite0084 NU33 "21 The term sukurúame is employed as both an adjective and a noun to convey several distinct meanings of differing specificity. Most generally, it means “strange, unusual, unfamiliar, foreign, or mysterious” and can describe anything or anyone that appears out of the ordinary. More specifically, it describes individuals and objects capable of influencing the behavior or well-being of others by means that are not generally available and therefore are mysterious. Included here are “magical” stones as well as people who possess special knowledge acquired from God or the Devil that allows them to cause or alleviate illnesses. Catholic priests sometimes are described as sukurúame in this sense because the Rarámuri assume that their relation with God is particularly close. Most specifically, sukurúame designates sorcerers and contrasts with several terms the Rarámuri use for “doctor”: rimérike (possibly from Spanish remedio, “remedy”), rotóri (from Spanish doctor ), and owirúame, “one who cures.” It also is applied to the animals and objects that sorcerers employ in their sorcery. In this sense, sukurúame has clearly evil connotations."
t0451 cite0084 NU33 "In the ensuing weeks, Calistro continued to lose weight and to talk, cry, and breathe heavily in his sleep. His in-laws were worried about his condition and puzzled by the failure of the bakánawi specialist’s cure. They asked Calistro about his past, trying to find something he might have done that would have led to his present state. They learned that when he was a small child, a peyote ceremony had been held at his parents’ home. Just after the ceremony ended, Calistro started playing on the patio where the performance had been staged and consequently, his in-laws reasoned, had come in contact with peyote."
t0452 cite0084 NU33 "God is usually benevolent to the Rarámuri because they are his children, but as with bakánawi and híkuri, their relationship with God is based ultimately on balanced reciprocity. The people repay God for his care and encourage his continued benevolence by offering him food in fiestas and acting in conformance with his teachings. If people fail to maintain the balance or to act properly, God will withdraw his care, thus giving the Devil free rein to harm them. If he is extremely displeased, he will ask the Devil to send illnesses, a request with which the Devil readily complies. God also can work harm more directly. For example, if people whom God has blessed with prolific herds refuse to return a portion of these animals to him by sacrificing them during fiestas, God will take the souls of these animals himself and may further punish the misers by reclaiming their souls or those of one or more of their children. The bakánawi specialist, it will be remembered, thought such an offense had caused Calistro’s illness. If parents neglect or are unduly harsh with their children, God will call the souls of the children back to heaven where he and his wife can care for them, thereby causing the parents anguish and sorrow. Also, the Rarámuri suspect that a slow and painful death is God’s punishment for crimes such as thievery or sorcery."
t0453 cite0084 NU33 "Calistro never gave much credence to the diagnosis implicating peyote, perhaps because this diagnosis implied that he participated, albeit unwittingly, in causing his illness. Instead, he suspected the outright malevolence of two of his neighbors, who he believed had bewitched him. Calistro’s symptoms were consistent with a diagnosis of sorcery because, like bakánawi and peyote, sorcerers are thought to tie up people’s extremities as well as steal their souls. Such attacks often are felt to occur when the victim has offended the sorcerer, but sometimes evil sorcerers will harm someone simply because they are malevolent. Calistro characterized his assumed assailants in this light, reinforcing this image by claiming that they directed their evil toward his defenseless child as well as toward him. To recover from sorcery, the victims must convince Rarámuri doctors to confront the sorcerers and force them to undo their evil. I never heard that Calistro engaged a doctor for this purpose, but such arrangements usually remain secret."
t0453 cite0084 NU33 "Calistro’s adherence to diagnoses in which he was not held directly responsible for his illness contrast with those proposed by his in-laws and doctors. In the early stages of the illness, these people concurred on diagnoses in which Calistro was not personally responsible for his misfortune. As the disease worsened, however, they increasingly placed the blame on him. By the end, they assumed that he was suffering from a venereal disease deriving ultimately if not directly from Chabochis."
t0453 cite0084 NU33 "The point of transition in the progression of the diagnosis came at the second appearance of the bakánawi specialist. By performing the first bakánawi ceremony for Calistro, the doctor acknowledged bakánawi ’s role in the ailment. He agreed to perform the second ceremony unaware of the extent of Calistro’s decline in the intervening six months. When he saw the severity of Calistro’s condition, he immediately shifted the responsibility from bakánawi, over whom he proclaimed some control, to God and ultimately to Calistro for his failure to fulfill his obligations to God. Since lingering illness is usually interpreted as God’s punishment, such a conclusion was accepted as reasonable by everyone but Calistro."
t0453 cite0084 NU33 "Calistro’s family, neighbors, and doctors were not trying to hurt Calistro by blaming him for his ailment. They were desperate to find a cure and assumed that such a terrible illness must have been punishment for something he had done. Severe illnesses tend to be diagnosed as caused by beings who are angry with the patient. Such diagnoses always imply that the sick person is at least partly responsible, so suggesting that Calistro had done something to bring on his illness was not unusual. What was unusual was Calistro’s refusal to accept responsibility. Most patients willingly admit their shortcomings because they can be cured only if the cause of their illness can be determined. Calistro did not do so, I think, because he had not committed adultery and truly believed he had not done the other things the diagnoses implied, like offending peyote or God. Yet he did not resist the treatments arranged for him by his wife’s parents even when these treatments were motivated by diagnoses with which he did not agree. He accepted these treatments because the other measures taken to alleviate his illness had failed. As his health declined, he also became increasingly resigned to the possibility of his death and willing to place his fate in the hands of others."
t0454 cite0085 NG06 "Serious illness was ascribed to personalized causes: retaliation from offended spirit beings or by sorcery for improper behavior or for having done wrong to another party, animal or human. Curing could involve a specialist's use of medicinal plant remedies, the sweat lodge, the Midewiwin ceremony, and a shaman's aid in soliciting the victim's confession of past taboo breaches or other acts that might have brought about the ailment (Hallowell 1992: 92-96)."
t0455 cite0086 NG06 "The tanning of hides (chiefly those of the deer) was the work of the women and was done in an expert manner, the hides being soft and colored a golden brown. An old woman said, “rabbit skin was a great help to the Indians.” She said that the women hung the hides on bushes for several days and part of the soft fur was blown away by the wind, but the “firmer” hair remained. Hides prepared in this way were used inside a cradle board and inside children's moccasins; they were also used in the making of children's caps. Rabbit skins were sewed together in patches to make blankets. The Mississippi Chippewa did not make woven rabbit-skin blankets like those used by the northern divisions of the tribe."
t0456 cite0087 NG06 "It is useless to withhold anything, because the doctor, with the aid of his other-than-human helpers, will probably find out what kind of bad conduct has followed me. Consequently, the discovery and articulation of it become equivalent to a confession of wrongdoing. [Page 413] This is an essential step, necessary to promote recovery. 19 Medicine can then do its work. Thus, confession adds considerable psychological force to the disease sanction. In order to get well, the individual has to suffer not only guilt, but the shame of exposure involved in confession—although this may relieve some of his anxiety."
t0456 cite0087 NG06 "19 Dunning points out that medicine men “were experts in the mytho-theological field of knowledge, who exploited and manipulated the situation on the basis of vision-acquired power … the basis of their authority lay in the general belief in retributive justice. If a man transgressed the mores of his society and did not become ill or die, he felt lucky and might tempt fate again by a repetition of the deed. Should he become ill, this would be clear evidence for himself and everyone that he had done wrong, and the social norms would be thus reinforced by his example. It was the duty of the medical specialist to probe the wrong behavior of the patient. And by public confession, not only did the patient recover from his illness, but the social norms of the society were upheld” (16, pp. 180–81)."
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "The Parry Island Ojibwa distinguish three kinds of medicine-men, who differed greatly in their methods. They were:"
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "(1) Wabeno: the healer and charm-maker;"
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "(2) Djiskiu: the conjuror;"
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "(3) Kusabindugeyu: the seer."
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "These three professions were mutually exclusive, so that no individual could ever become both a djiskiu and a kusabindugeyu, or a kusabindugeyu and a wabeno. Although each practitioner received a special “call” in a vision at adolescence, he might not practise until he reached maturity. Even then, the Indians say, he could not use his powers continuously, but only about once a month. For the medicine-man exhausted himself physically and mentally whenever he practised his art; too frequent exertion overstrained his powers, antagonized the supernatural being who had granted him his blessing, and brought about his death. Once a month, however, the moon, which renews the mysterious power in women, likewise renewed the medicine-man's power, so that he could safely peer into the future or effect one cure every four weeks."
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "Certain natives gave a slightly different explanation of the reason why a medicine-man could perform only at infrequent intervals. Each day in the year, they claimed, was controlled by a special manido, and since the medicine-man's powers were derived from and controlled by one of those supernatural beings, he could employ them only on the day or days his manido was functioning. This was partly the reason, they asserted, why the adolescent boy fasted one or two days the first month, two or three days the second, three or four days the third; for by this progression he would finally light on a day whose manido would consent to bless him. It explained, also, why no one ever thought of urging a medicine-man to practise his art on any particular day. If a woman had lost some treasured [Page 61] possession, the chief of the band might summon a meeting of all the medicine-men; but instead of selecting one special man to discover the lost article he passed a pipe around and asked, “Is there any one here who can help the woman?” On certain days the pipe circulated around unsmoked, because each medicine-man knew that his powers were for the time being inoperative. Only the man whose manido happened to be functioning on that day would venture to smoke the pipe and volunteer his services."
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "Many Indians acquired a reputation for great skill in the cure of diseases by the use of herbal remedies. They were known as mashkikike-wanini: “medicine-workmen or herbalists”; but in the eyes of their fellow-tribesmen they were not true medicine-men because they derived their powers from a purely human knowledge of the effects of various plants, not from a vision and blessing conferred by the supernatural world. For the same reason the majority of the Parry Islanders do not regard as genuine medicine-men the members ( medé) of the Midewiwin or Grand Medicine Society. 1 This society never succeeded in establishing itself on the island, at least within the memory of its present inhabitants; but the natives know of its existence in other bands, and that it numbers two ex-members even among themselves. They believe that wherever it exists most medicine-men join it in order to use their knowledge and powers as medé during the intervals when their true medicine-powers are quiescent, because it enables a djiskiu or a kusabindugeyu to prescribe herbal remedies for which his real profession gives him no authority. As currently used on Parry island, however, the term medé carries an evil connotation, and is practically synonymous with sorcerer or witch."
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "From a natural magnification of things distant and unknown, the Parry Islanders entertain considerable awe of foreign medicine-men. Some of them who know of the Blackfoot and Assiniboine tribes to the westward assert that the shadow ( udjibbom) of every Blackfoot keeps guard over his kinsmen, so that however scattered a family may be, each member enjoys the protection of all the rest. The Assiniboine ( Sin-e-buan: “stone medicine-men”) are even more dangerous. Originally they were a group of medicine-men so powerful that they separated off from other people and became a distinct tribe. Today their medicine-men, buan, who use a water-drum ( buankik) like the members of the Grand Medicine Society, are more powerful than any other; they can read a man's thoughts at a single glance, and hear the cry of a drowning friend and save him even though he may be 100 miles away. But no one can become a buan except through the help of the Sinebuan or Assiniboine, who first kill him, then restore him to life again."
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "“My foster-father's brother, Buankins, once went west, encountered the Sinebuan and became a buan. He could sense the needs of strangers the moment he entered their camp. People used to visit him continually to ask his advice in sickness. He did not undertake to cure them, but advised them to gather some herb or other and use it” (Pegahmagabow)."
t0457 cite0088 NG06 "If we exclude the medé, however, only the three classes of medicine-men previously mentioned played any important rôle in the lives of the Parry Island Ojibwa."
t0458 cite0088 NG06 WABENO
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "The word wabeno comes from waban: “the twilight that precedes the dawn”; but the Indians interpreted it in two different ways. One man thought that it signified “daylight comes,” and referred to the strength of a man in the early morning. Another translated it as “eastern man,” because a wabeno walks sunwise (i.e. clockwise) round a plant until he stands on its western side, facing the eastern sky, before he plucks the leaf or root he requires to make his medicine. Legend states that the first wabeno, Bidabbans: “Day-dawn,” received his power from the moon."
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "“Day-dawn's child died, and the father wept aloud for it. Moon said to him, ‘Do not weep, for your child shall come to life again. Call together ten men and ten women.’ He called the ten men and the ten women. Moon then gave him a drum, and inspired him with a song; and as he drummed and sang the ten men and the ten women danced. Day-dawn raised his head and looked at them. Behold, his dead child was alive again and dancing with them. ‘This is the blessing I have bestowed on you,’ said Moon. ‘Hereafter you shall heal the sick. Had you not wept for your child, mankind would always return to life.’ Day-dawn regretted his error, but it was too late; man cannot now return from the grave. Nevertheless, the people brought a sick man to Day-dawn and he healed him” (Jim Nanibush)."
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "The wabeno was a healer of diseases, and a maker of love and hunting medicines. Like the herbalist and the medé, he specialized in plant medicines; but he had greater power and knowledge than these two classes of practitioners, because he had received a direct blessing (“diploma”) from some supernatural being during his boyhood fast. The earliest wabenos are reported to have learned the properties of the various plants from dreams. This source then became practically closed; but the old knowledge was handed down from generation to generation, and youths aspiring to be wabenos apprenticed themselves to established practitioners, who for payment would impart their secrets. Yet no one might offer himself as a candidate who had not first received the supernatural sanction during his period of fast; for the wabeno's real power was deemed to reside less in the plants themselves than in the added virtues they acquired through his association with a manido."
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "There was nothing formal about the apprenticeship. The novice merely visited his teacher from time to time and learned whatever the older man was willing to impart. He might purchase knowledge from a number of practitioners, as opportunities arose, until his final pharmacopia became a medley from several sources. With the outward technique of the profession he was already familiar from childhood; for it was a common pastime of the children to drum and dance and sing wabeno songs in imitation of the real medicine-men. Nevertheless, he could not “graduate” and set himself up in practice until he had given a public exhibition of his supernatural powers at a feast and dance held in conjunction with other wabenos."
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "The wabeno was a highly honoured public official, in a sense, for he was the servant of his community, even though he was entitled to charge a fee for his services. Since his prestige depended partly on his popularity he generally gave a public feast and dance whenever a patient paid for the remedy that dispelled his sickness, or a hunter offered fitting compensation for the medicine that had delivered the game into his hands. These feasts and dances, unlike those of the Grand Medicine Society, [Page 63] were open to every one, men, women, and children. They were held in any conveniently large wigwam, began and ended with feasting, and lasted, as a rule, throughout an entire night. The leading wabeno initiated the dancing by advancing into the centre of the wigwam and beating his tambourine, which differed in no way from a secular tambourine except that the deerskin membrane sometimes bore a painting of its owner's manido. The people fell into line behind him, and danced and sang around the central fire. When the first wabeno ceased drumming and resumed his seat another stepped forward and led the throng. At intervals in the dances one of the medicine-men might drum and dance alone around the fire, then, stooping, pick up from the embers a hot stone; or he might dip his fingers into a boiling cauldron, extract a piece of meat, and swallow it without evidence of pain. Some Indians say that he derived these powers from the medicines he rubbed on his hands, and that although he neither ate nor drank for four days and four nights previously, his strength remained totally unimpaired."
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "“I have seen a wabeno swallow a knife that was a foot long. Only the handle protruded from his mouth. He walked around the fire four times that all who were present might see him, then slowly withdrew the knife” (James Walker)"
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "“A wabeno knows instinctively, as it were, if his son has received a visit and blessing from a manido. He checks the lad from playing with other children, and makes him remain quietly at home or in a separate hut” (Pegahmagabow)."
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "The true medicine-man, whether wabeno, kusabindugeyu, or djiskiu, always used his power to help his fellow-men, and, consequently, one of his principal duties was to foil the machinations of sorcerers. The wabeno had reputedly more power than the members of the other two professions, more power, too, than any sorcerer or medé. Now a sorcerer often sought to compass the death of his enemy by magically shooting into his body a piece of bone, splinter of wood, or other object that only a medicine-man could discover and remove. When a man fell ill from this cause the wabeno diagnosed the seat of the malady and laid over it a piece of birch bark, or a leaf smeared with one of his composite herbal remedies. After drumming and singing he drew away the leaf, drawing away at the same time the stick or bone that caused the infection. At times he might even attack the sorcerer himself, “shooting” him with sickness just as the sorcerer shot his victims."
t0458 cite0088 NG06 "“Once a wabeno and a medé held a contest to see who was the more powerful. They built their wigwams a few yards apart, and each man sat inside his lodge with the contents of his medicine-bag spread out in front of him. The medé had a large bag full of many medicines, the wabeno a small bag containing only a few. They sat and shot at one another. The magic feather, stick, or other missile sped through the air unseen and struck its victim in the chest; but the wounded man simply rubbed his body with medicine and extracted it. Thus they fought all through the day, shooting at each other alternately, until at last the wameno had but one medicine left. He called to the medé, ‘I have but one medicine left; if that fails you will kill me.’ It was a pinch of sand about the size of an ordinary charge of powder. He shot, and the sand penetrated into every part of the medé's body, rendering the counter-medicine useless. The man's body and limbs swelled up until he died. Thus the wabeno proved his superiority” (Jonas King)."
t0459 cite0088 NG06 KUSABINDUGEYU
t0459 cite0088 NG06 "The kusabindugeyu 1 were primarily seers, gifted by their adolescent visions to discern what was normally hidden from human eyes. Most [Page 64] of them claimed to derive their power from thunder, but during the winter months, when thunder had retreated far to the southward (thunderstorms are exceedingly rare in Parry Sound during the winter) they summoned other manidos to aid them in their rites, principally perhaps a small owl ( kokoko) and the whip-poor-will ( waholi). Instead of a tambourine, they 1 used a disk-like rattle ( shishigwan) of parchment 6 to 9 inches in diameter, handleless, but with a loose flap of skin pierced with a hole for suspension. This instrument, and some hollow bone tubes, formed their entire stock-in-trade; for, unlike the wabeno, the kusabindugeyu never employed herbal remedies in his profession, although he might use them as a layman, or if he happened to be a member of the Grand Medicine Society."
t0459 cite0088 NG06 "The kusabindugeyu claimed to pry into the future, to behold what was far away, and to discern what was hidden inside a man's body. Others might dream about these things, but the real seer professed to behold them with his own eyes even in broad daylight. Some Parry Islanders believe that he could discover the secret thoughts of distant people and evoke an enemy's shadow ( udjibbom), causing insanity and perhaps death; but that he never used this power to the detriment of his own people. His procedure was simple in the extreme. Kneeling on the ground he sang his medicine-song and shook his rattle. A manido entered it with a dull thud audible to all around; sometimes three or four manidos, if he continued to shake the rattle. They gave no other sign of their presence, but merely opened the seer's eyes so that he might behold the object of his quest."
t0459 cite0088 NG06 "“In my boyhood I had a swelling on the neck which emitted much pus when lanced. My mother called in an old blind kusabindugeyu to discover whether I would die. He said to her ‘I will tell you to-morrow.’ On the morrow he came again and said ‘Your boy will recover when the snow lies half an inch thick on the ground. He will not die, for I have seen him living far down the years.’ The seer spoke truly. The swelling disappeared in the early winter and I am now an old man” (James Walker)."
t0459 cite0088 NG06 "Hollow bone tubes made from bird's leg-bones formed part of the kusabindugeyu's equipment and took the place of the wabeno's remedies. By means of his rattle the seer first sought the stick or other object implanted in the sick man's body. If the case were hopeless and death impending the rattle emitted a strange smell; but if the object became visible it was possible for the medicine-man to extract it with his tubes. He swallowed from one to six of them, allowing the last one to protrude slightly from his mouth. Through this he sucked against the infected spot, drew out the object, and vomited all the tubes at once into a basin of clean water. No one might speak or make a noise while the operation lasted lest a sudden sound should cause the medicine-man to choke and kill himself."
t0459 cite0088 NG06 "“My brother once suffered from a constant pain between the shoulders, and my mother sent me to bring a kusabindugeyu. The seer came, and after drinking some whisky and smoking his pipe, laid his rattle on the ground beside the fire. There it emitted two loud cracks as a manido entered it. He took it up again, and danced and sang around the fire. Then he drew out two bone tubes, one much longer than the other, and swallowed them; but the short tube protruded a little from his mouth. [Page 65] Kneeling beside my brother he sucked violently with this short tube against the skin between the shoulders. Suddenly he vomited both tubes into a basin of clean water my mother had set beside him. ‘Look,’ he exclaimed, as he held up the bowl and carried it round for us to examine. Floating on the water with the bones was something that looked like a tiny feather about half an inch long, at one end of which was a minute black speck. ‘That black speck,’ the medicine-man said, ‘would grow and grow inside the boy's body until it killed him.’ He removed his tubes and drank all the water, swallowing the feather with it. My brother recovered very quickly. Not long afterwards this same kusabindugeyu healed another sick man by sucking out of his body, with the longer of his two tubes, a quantity of yellow bile” (James Walker)."
t0459 cite0088 NG06 "Occasionally a sorcerer produced sickness not by implanting an object in the body of his victim, but by stealing away his soul. A medicine-man might discover where it was hidden and restore it. If he failed, and the sick man was an important member of the community, relatives sometimes engaged two or three kusabindugeyu to sacrifice a white dog. They bound the animal, laid it on top of a pile of sticks, and stunned it with a club (or in some cases, the Indians thought, rendered it unconscious with a drug). Then they set fire to the pile, and, kneeling in front of it, tried to discern the location of the missing soul. Any wriggling or howling of the dog was an evil omen that rendered their efforts vain. The Parry Islanders claim that this dog-sacrifice was a very ancient custom of their people, although resorted to only in grave emergencies."
t0459 cite0088 NG06 "“In early times the skies were always cloudless, but heavy fogs at night often caused the dew to drip from the wigwams. The first cloud arose in the east just before the coming of white men. The Indians did not understand the warning, so they sacrified a white dog, and six kusabindugeyu knelt with their faces to the ground, three on one side of the pyre and three on the other. Thus they discovered what the clouds signified. Since that day the skies have been often clouded and thunderstorms frequent” (Pegahmagabow)."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 DJISKIU
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "The Djiskiu, or, as he was more rarely called, Djasakid, ranked as high or higher than the kusabindugeyu, 1 but employed a totally different method for diagnosing the causes of sickness and for discovering things lost or far away. He used neither a drum nor a rattle, but conjured up his helping spirits inside a cylindrical lodge that was especially built for the purpose and afterwards dismantled. We may, therefore, call him a conjuror, as contrasted with the seer, kusabindugeyu, who laid claim to second sight, and the wabeno, who restricted himself almost exclusively to herbal medicines."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "The conjuror, like the other two classes of medicine-men, derived his power from a vision at puberty, when a manido visited him and conferred upon him the special gift of divining by means of the conjuring lodge. Most conjurors claimed thunder as their manido, because thunder was credited with granting the greatest power. They underwent no training subsequent to their visions, but could not practise until they reached manhood; for although the manido's blessing gave them the requisite supernatural power, they needed full strength of mind and body to make use of it. Only men in the prime of life could conjure, and then not more often [Page 66] than once a month, or perhaps two or three times in a summer; the ordeal was too exhausting, or, as the Indians say, the helping spirits disturbed too greatly the medicine-man's soul. Hence a great many conjurors were also medé, able to prescribe herbal remedies every day in the year, even in old age when their conjuring powers were extinguished."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "The djiskan, or conjuring lodge, consisted of six or eight poles arranged in a circle to enclose a space about 4 feet in diameter. A hoop encircled them near the top, partly to hold the frame together, partly to provide a seat for the helping spirits. Four deer dew-claws attached to one of the poles rattled whenever the lodge was shaken, and rolls of birch bark, or in recent times cloth, enveloped the entire frame to a height of about 6 feet."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "It was not the conjuror who erected this lodge, but the people who requisitioned his services. On rare occasions they set up two lodges within a few feet so that the medicine-man might place his coat inside one and himself enter the other; both lodges then shook during his séance. The Indians claim that an exceptionally powerful conjuror could mark off the space for a lodge by creating a hollow in the ground 3 feet deep with a single sweep of his hand, and that a second wave of his hand at the conclusion of his séance restored the ground to its original position."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "Let us imagine ourselves now in an Indian camp, sharing all the views of the Parry Islanders as to what takes place during a conjuror's séance. Some man has hired him to discover why a relative lies dangerously ill, and, with the assistance of friends, has erected a proper conjuring lodge."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "We idle around until dusk, for, unlike the kusabindugeyu, the conjuror may not operate in full daylight. At last he approaches, crawls beneath the birch-bark envelope and disappears within. He is speaking. We cannot distinguish the words, but we know he is calling the manido that blessed him during his puberty fast, and the other manidos that always lend their aid. There is a sudden thud, and the lodge rocks violently, for a spirit ( medewadji: a spirit of the conjuring lodge) has entered it. Another thud and further rocking; then another, and still another. Perhaps a voice says “What do you want me for?,” and snapping turtle ( mashikkan) answers: “We do not want your help.” Inside the lodge there are now five or six medewadji or manidos, souls or spirits of animals like the bear and the serpent, who have assembled together with the spirit of thunder, their chief, and of snapping turtle, longest-lived of all creatures, their interpreter. We cannot see them, but we understand that turtle rests at the bottom of the lodge, feet up, keeping it from sinking into the ground; that thunder is at the top, covering it like a lid; and that the other spirits are perched around the hoop that encircles the frame. 1 They look like human beings about 4 inches tall, but have long ears and squeaking voices like bats."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "Meanwhile the conjuror has been kneeling on the floor of the lodge with his face to the ground, and remains thus (supposedly) throughout the performance. Probably he has omitted to take any tobacco inside with him, and since the manidos require a little tribute before they set about their task his employer must hand in some tobacco over the top [Page 67] of the lodge. A brief period of silence follows, and the faint aroma of tobacco smoke floats from the shrine. Then the manidos discuss among themselves the cause of the sick man's condition. They decide that a sorcerer has bewitched him, so with a violent rocking of the lodge one of them departs to summon the soul of the offender for trial."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "The audience outside the lodge now becomes visibly excited, and the employer of the conjuror draws nearer. Again the lodge rocks as the manido brings in the sorcerer's soul. “Is it you who have caused my son's sickness?” shouts the employer. “Is it you?” The soul cannot avoid confessing if the sorcerer is guilty. “Shall we kill him? Shall we kill him?” shout the medewadji in their squeaky voices, while thunder closely guards the top of the lodge to prevent the soul's escape. “No, not yet,” replies the man, who is generally afraid of being held responsible for the sorcerer's death. “Let him restore my son to health and pay us fitting compensation. How much will be pay?” So the man outside and the soul within bargain with one another until they arrive at an agreement. Then the manidos release the soul, which returns to its owner; and the lodge rocks for the last time as they themselves depart. The séance has ended. The exhausted conjuror crawls out from his shelter and retires to his tent. Tomorrow, or the next day perhaps, the relatives of the sick man will pay him for his toil."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "The performance just described explains the general character of these séances; but no two of them were exactly alike, not only because they were held for different needs, but because each conjuror had his special methods. On rare occasions he might even remain outside the lodge (presumably after concealing a confederate within). Sometimes, it is said, his medewadji or helping spirits cured sickness by exchanging the soul of the patient with that of a man in perfect health; the latter merely felt indisposed for a short time until his new soul regained strength. Or, again, when a band of Indians were starving, the helping spirits summoned and killed the shadow of a moose or deer; then the next day the hunters killed the animal itself, which no longer possessed a shadow to warn it of danger."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "“I once helped to erect a djiskan so that a conjuror might discover why a certain child was ill. We heard the manidos say to one another inside the lodge ‘We cannot do anything. The child will have to die.’ The child died” (Jonas King). ..."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "Some of the Parry Islanders credit the conjurors, or individual members of the profession, with the most extraordinary powers, exceeding those of the kusabindugeyu and wabeno. They report that a conjuror has taken a man by the ankle and lifted him high in the air with one hand; has loosened himself, unaided, from a network of ropes that bound him; has destroyed, with the aid of thunder, evil serpents that preyed on the Indians' camps; and has even sent his helping spirits with a load of furs 60 miles to a trading post, whence they brought back several cases of whisky within an hour."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "“Before there was a settlement at Parry sound, Bill King and two or three other Indians exhausted their supply of flour and bacon; but they had four marten skins. One of the Indians was a conjuror, so Bill and his companions erected a djiskan for him. They passed the four marten skins inside the lodge, and within a few minutes the conjuror produced in exchange for them a 50-pound sack of flour which his medewadji had brought from Penetanguishene 100 miles away” (Jonas King)."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "The Indians on Parry island today live in constant fear of witchcraft, to which they attribute many deaths, believing that it has greatly increased since conjurors disappeared from their midst. Formerly, they say, the conjuror could punish the sorcerer by summoning his soul into the djiskan, where one of the helping spirits, at the request of the dead man's relatives, would kill it with a sharpened stick of cedar. “Get out of my way. I'll kill it,” the spirits would cry as they vied with one another to execute their victim. Sorcerers whose souls thus perished immediately fell sick and died. Hence many of them wore as amulets ( wadjigan) small stones or pieces of bone resembling a human face, which protected their souls from the clutches of the spirits and allowed them to practise their witchcraft unpunished."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "“When I was a young man living at Shawanaga a medewadji tried several nights in succession to carry away my soul. I am sure it was a conjuror who was trying to harm me, because my father and grandfather had offended some of the Indians on lake Huron, and these Indians destroyed by sorcery every member of their families except myself” (Pegahmagabow)."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "Not every conjuror, one Indian said, had the courage to permit his helping spirits to destroy a sorcerer's soul, even after he held it prisoner within his djiskan. The audience outside might feel that there were extenuating circumstances, that the man had perhaps acted in self-defence. Then the spirits would release the soul, and at some later time a court of medés and wabenos would retry the case. They built a fire of sticks and stationed the accused man beside it. If he were guilty the sticks changed into snakes and killed him."
t0460 cite0088 NG06 "Like the wabeno, the conjuror sometimes entertained his countrymen with a feast and dance, but the entertainment was purely secular and the dancers employed an ordinary drum."
t0461 cite0089 NG06 "Religious leaders were also limited in their use of power by the belief that overuse of talents led to disease in the specialist's family (Kidder 1918: 85–88). Some Ojibwas were ambitious enough to sacrifice the health of their families but for the most part this belief acted as a control on the search for religious powers. Most shamans ceased their activity rather than endanger their families."
t0462 cite0090 NM09 "False Faces and Husk Faces, as well as the musical instruments of the curing societies, are not deemed proper objects to accompany the dead, even though the person may have acquired these in the same manner as an eagle wand. ... if the deceased had been an herbal curer, all his or her “medicines” should be buried separately in the earth. They may be dug up again after the ten-day mourning period and used by another specialist, if he is sure of the proper usage. However, by far the safest course is to bury the medicine and leave it buried, because “it might be dangerous” after the rightful owner has died. Medicines are individualistic and dangerous, and might work only for the “doctor” who originally owned them and knew how to use them. But in this case, too, relatives are loath to discard a useful material, and some keep the medicines and merely purify them by smoking them with pine branches and the burnt root of skwa[unknown] eda (coltsfoot), after the tenth-day feast. Occasionally, an individual will express a wish to “take along” his favorite snow snake or walking stick, and such desires are granted. However, no informant at Six Nations could remember seeing any wampum in a coffin, as has been reported in the literature and is found in archeological excavations."
t0463 cite0090 NM09 "Whether the medicine is collected by an amateur or by a specialist, the techniques are identical. Spring and fall are the preferred seasons for the collection of plants; however, any time of the year is acceptable except “when the lightening bugs are out” (June and July), for it is thought that in midsummer the roots are hollow, thus reducing the strength of the preparations. Nevertheless, if a plant is needed during midsummer, it is procured and used, although an extra dosage is added in an attempt to achieve the usual strength. The collector should go out early in the day, and, to the first exemplar encountered of each desired species, he should give some Indian tobacco and respectfully inform it that a specimen is desired as a medicine for disease X for person Y. The tobacco which is offered to the plant is the most important tool of the herbalist, for it is the tobacco which transmits the message to the spirit force of the plant, thus permitting the individual specimens to be effective. The tobacco is also a reciprocal gift to the spirit force. In an emergency, herbalists use medicine collected without tobacco, but it is considered to be very weak indeed. The Indian name of the designee should be mentioned, but if the medicine is not intended for any particular person, the plant should be informed that the medicine is being collected for future use for “anyone at all.” Thereafter, any other specimens may be procured. However, should any untoward signs appear immediately before or during the collection of the plants--such as a snake crossing his path or the appearance of a hearse, an inebriated person, or a menstruating woman--the collector should either turn the other way or preferably refrain from collecting that day, since the medicine picked after such an incident is at best not of full strength and possibly even dangerous. Of course, a woman must never collect medicine during her menstrual period, for medicine is particularly prone to [Page 265] spoilage by any contact with a catamenial woman (see pp. 216-7 supra ). Due to the danger of damaging the medicine by an ominous encounter and also in part due to fear of being suspected of witchcraft, collectors usually pursue their tasks in secret. Once home they are quite willing to admit having collected plants in the morning, though there exists, particularly among the specialists, a certain reluctance to divulge the location of the plants and the ingredients of the medicines."
t0464 cite0090 NM09 "The fact that a person allows himself to be treated at the hospital does not indicate that he abandons a search for the cause of his disease, for the purely physiological explanations of the Ohsweken physician are not always persuasive. Longhouse members do talk in terms of “germs” and “high blood pressure,” and on that level they understand natural cause-and-effect relationships. However, they continue suspiciously to wonder why they, as particular individuals, are subjected to the disease. This is especially true if the disease is lingering and hard to cure, or if the hospital is unable to diagnose why the patient “feels bad.” Surely, there must then be something causing the disease which white man's medicine cannot understand and does not have the historical perspective to appreciate, and it is therefore necessary to find the true etiology of the disease (a typically “Indian” cause) and apply an “Indian” treatment. To determine the true etiology one has recourse to an Indian specialist, namely, the fortuneteller."
t0465 cite0090 NM09 "Boys may “pick up” the songs while they are young and help sing for years before having to join the society for one reason or another. Since active ritualists sing in many societies, the obligations which would be incumbent on them were they formally to “join” each one would be rather strenuous. Sometimes, however, an illness of a performer is attributed to his not being a member or not being “strong enough” to have contact with such powerful medicine. When this diagnosis is made, the performer usually joins the society in which he has been singing, and some singers do finally join a formidable number of societies. Perhaps the leniency with which the Six Nations medicine societies accept the participation of nonmembers is simply an indication of the scarcity of trained specialists (for fewer and fewer of the boys “pick up” the song cycles) and an instance of flexibility under difficult circumstances. Whatever the reason, the fact does show that the societies are not exclusive or “secret.”"
t0466 cite0091 NM09 "The curing ceremony itself might call for the services of a shamanistic specialist. One such ritual was the awataerohi (J.R. 10:183; 13:31, 171; 13:187-189; 17:171; 21:151). The disease was named after the “demon” which imbedded itself in the body causing pain at a particular spot. This spirit was the size of a fist and could only be exorcised by dancing, juggling, and chewing hot coals and rubbing the body of the patient. The ability to handle these coals without getting burnt depended on powers received in a dream-vision. One man who had been this particular type of shaman related to the Jesuits how his twenty-year career began. When he first aspired to this type of shamanistic ability, he was unable to handle the coals without getting burnt. He was getting discouraged when one night he had a dream that [Page 64] he was performing the ceremony flawlessly and painlessly. What enabled him to do this was a song that he was singing which he had never heard before. He awoke and remembered the song. At the next occasion when such a ceremony was needed he was able to participate. As soon as he began to sing his song, he went into an ecstatic state and not only handled the hot coals, but put his arm in a boiling kettle without pain or physical harm. In the future he occasionally had dreams that he should wear a special garment while doing the ceremony, or a special ornament. He never failed to follow these “revelations” and therefore never lost his magico-religious power (J.R. 21:153). It must be noted that this power did not extend to other types of rituals, but that nevertheless he had been able to heal and help many people over his twenty years of doing the awataerohi. Sagard describes this ceremony and claims that it took place in a darkened hut."
t0467 cite0092 NM09 "The handles of spoons are frequently carved with designs which are ornamental, totemistic, or in response to dreams, particularly those occurring during some indisposition or illness. The dreams are interpreted by a local seer or medical practitioner, who decides upon the design, also the kind of wood, the presentation of such dream-objects to the patient being necessitated to secure recovery. Failure in this respect is believed to be followed by continued illness and eventually by death. The custom seems to have been based upon the belief that the soul can depart from the body and that satisfaction of its desires must be obtained to bring about its return."
t0468 cite0093 NA12 "The vocabulary naturally reflects the meteorological phenomena. These were often personified or believed to be controlled by beings and were thought to be affected by the actions of men, especially by breaches [Page [p.30-b]] of taboo. Not only were there almost professional weather forecasters whose expert advice was consulted before voyages were undertaken, but most persons were observant of weather signs to be read in the look of the mountains, and both shamans and laymen knew magic to control the weather."
t0469 cite0093 NA12 "A weather prophet, ‘outside one-who-is-watching’ or ‘outside one-who-tells’ (gán [unknown]lA-tínì, gánkA nigi), was not a shaman but rather an expert whose advice was sought and respected. “The people consulted him before going hunting. He could tell by the clouds. He was just a wise man [not a doctor],” said MJ of her uncle CkInan who was such an expert."
t0470 cite0094 NF06 "Like other peoples, the Blackfoot Indians employed simple home remedies for minor ailments, but when someone was seriously ill they called upon a man or woman who had magic powers with which to cure the sick. The Blackfeet believed disease was caused by an evil spirit entering a person’s body and that it could be cured by a doctor who possessed the power to expell the spirit. As Blackfoot doctors received their detailed instructions for curing the sick in dreams, their methods differed. Many, however, employed singing, drumming, and calling upon their supernatural helper for assistance. Not uncommonly, the doctor appeared to extract some small object from the sick person’s body as proof that the cause of illness had been removed. Some doctors were specialists in treating broken bones, snake bites, or battle wounds. Many of the most renowned doctors were women. It was customary to pay the doctor one or more horses for his services. The family of a victim of a prolonged illness might give all their possessions to the Indian doctor."
t0471 cite0095 NF06 "The Blackfeet had a Love medicine, which they called Ito-wa-mami-wa-natsi (Cree medicine), because it was generally obtained from the Crees, who were specialists in its manufacture. In talking with E-kum-makon about the Cree medicine, he said that he had used it to regain the affection of his young wife. When she left him and returned to her father’s lodge, he made a long journey north, to visit a Cree medicine man, from whom he purchased some of the Love medicine. It consisted of a small beaded buckskin bag containing a sweet-smelling powder. As the Cree magician had directed, he secured one of his wife’s hairs and, winding it with one of his own, placed them together in the medicine bag. He carried it with him everywhere, fastened around his neck by a buckskin string and wore it beneath his shirt. He firmly believed in its power, because his wife had returned and became so much attached to him, that she was unwilling to leave his side and they went everywhere together. Soon after this E-kum-makon had a severe illness, lasting so long he thought he must be bewitched by Little Plume, who owned a Porcupine-Quill medicine. It consisted of a small stone, or wooden image of a person, a porcupine quill and some red paint, by which the owner was able to cast an evil spell over people. [Page 191] If he placed the red paint between the eyes of the image, the one whom he desired to injure became ill; if over the lungs, he had a hemorrhage; if on the top of the head, he became crazy; if over the heart, it caused death. E-kum-makon became so worried over his health, that he again sought the advice of the Cree medicine man, who informed him that his sickness was caused by the improper use of the Love medicine. It should not have been carried around with him, but left inside his tipi, tied to one of the lodge poles, where it properly belonged. The medicine man also explained, that it was wrong to put the hairs into the bag without the burning of incense, which was necessary to ward off the Evil Power."
t0472 cite0096 NQ18 "A sensitivity to the stars is apparent in nearly every aspect of Skidi life, as was indicated by Murie and Dorsey:"
t0472 cite0096 NQ18 "At birth a child came under the influence of a supernatural being--a particular star shining especially bright--who was supposed to manifest himself later in the child’s life. Usually this manifestation occurred when the child fell ill, at which time medicine-men were sent for. When the right one appeared, he could cure the child, for he possessed the power from the star noted above [1940:115]."
t0472 cite0096 NQ18 "Weltfish, speaking of the Pawnee person, observed:"
t0472 cite0096 NQ18 "He was literally trained to feel that the world around him was his home--kahuraru, the universe, meaning literally the inside land, and that his house was a small model of it. The infinite cosmos was his constant source of strength and his ultimate progenitor...[1977:57-58]."
t0472 cite0096 NQ18 "Thus all the Skidi people apparently were quite familiar with the stars at one time. But it was the priests who were the most knowledgeable of all, as the quotation from Murie which began this chapter indicates. Murie also appropriately drew attention to the fact that we now possess few of the actual details of the Skidi system: “The reader should always bear in mind that we are [Page 166] catching up the frayed-out ends of a vanishing fabric and that many times these come to us as but glimpses of what has passed into hopeless oblivion.” In this chapter we will use geometry, together with the reliable repetitions of astronomy, to attempt to reconstruct at least a part of the pattern of that vanished fabric."
t0473 cite0097 NQ18 "The Pawnee recognized witchcraft and, ultimately, anger and hostility, to be a major cause of disease. Pawnee religious specialists also included shamans who cured the sick through powers believed to have been acquired from animal spirits. Shamans were organized into societies with specific rituals performed twice each year in order to perpetuate and renew their powers."
t0474 cite0098 NT09 "Before a duma is ready to be installed in its piki house, it must be levelled off by grinding with coarse gravel or by pounding with a rock until it is smooth and even. Cotton seed is then chewed or ground to extract an oil with which the stone is carefully polished. The actual installation must be performed in secret by a skilled baker. If the owner of the new stone lacks the necessary experience, she calls on a trusted kinswoman to act for her, but if a woman has the requisite skill, she may do the work herself. 69 After the duma is in [Page p.198] position, a fire is built under it with piñon wood as fuel. It is regulated carefully to a medium heat as excessive firing would tend to crack the stone. Once the stone is heated to the right degree a quantity of piñon sap is rubbed in thoroughly, after which an oily mixture of crushed watermelon seeds is applied and allowed to penetrate."

t0475 cite0099 NT09 "Hopinavoti is the general category of Hopi ideation that provides thoroughgoing analyses that are comparable to anthropological analyses, in that they stem from a demarcated tradition of interpretation that is specialized, restricted, and “expert.” Navoti indicates a system of knowledge that includes philosophy, science, and theology and incorporates conceptual models for explaining the past and predicting, or “prophesying,” future events (for those convinced that Hopi is a “timeless language,” see Malotki's 1982 critique of Whorf's view): in short, it is a sort of Hopi hermeneutics. The predictive element and the temporal connection between cause and effect mean that present conditions can be explained by reference to past predictions and that future events will in some way reflect contemporary “prophecy”—a term used for navoti in Hopi English (“theory” is another)."
t0475 cite0099 NT09 "The nature and depth of understanding of Hopinavoti differs. Sukavungsinom are regarded as having a shallower understanding than pavansinom. With regard to ritual symbolism, for example, discrete layers of meaning are recognized by the more knowledgeable, who can and do identify the more profound layers in appropriate circumstances. An obvious parallel in western society is between the knowledge claimed by the academic community and the intelligentsia in general over the meanings and functioning of phenomena, and the “common-sense” understandings of the “general public.” However, the structure of knowledge distribution in Hopi society departs from this parallel and is more aptly compared to established ecclesiastical structures differentiating a clerical hierarchy from a laity. The boundaries separating a navotiytaqa (literally, a “man of knowledge”—a common term for distinguishing the validity of an interpretation's source) from others are maintained by strict controls on access to knowledge. We might portray the sociology of Hopi knowledge as a series of concentric rings marking boundaries of secrecy between circles of knowledge or, as [Page 256] Barth (1975:passim) suggests for the Baktaman, as an assemblage of Chinese boxes."
t0476 cite0100 OI08 "“On one occasion a celebrated rain-maker had to enlist the help of other magicians and sundry old men to help him break the drought that for a long time past had held Deep Well in an iron grip. (1) To this end they performed many secret ceremonies. They then went to the ranges and, standing on the top of one, waved in circles eagle-hawk's wings held in both hands, to draw in their direction the promising clouds that were rising. The rain [70] came, and continued far too long for the rain-maker's comfort; so he again enlisted the help of his former assistants to stop it. This was accomplished by the whole of them shouting their loudest, and striking at the rain with sticks, and assuming all sorts of threatening attitudes. After this notable success he was regarded by all as a specialist at the game."
t0477 cite0101 OI08 "Another form of Arungquilta which produces comets is brought about in the following way, and is only used for punishing women. If a woman runs away from her husband and he is unable to recover her, he and his friends-that is, men of his local group--assemble at a secluded spot, where a man skilled in magic draws upon the surface of a small patch of ground, which has been cleared and smoothed down for the purpose, a rough diagram, of which the accompanying sketch is a copy. This drawing is simply marked out on the ground with the finger, and is intended to represent the figure of the woman lying down on her back. It is called Aworra, a term which has much the same significance as the word emblem. 1 While the drawing is being made, and throughout the whole proceedings, low chants are sung, the burden of which is an exhortation to the Arungquilta to go out and enter her body and dry up all of her fat. When the drawing is done, a piece of green bark is placed at the spot marked with an asterisk. This is supposed to represent the spirit part of the woman, and then all the men who are present stick into it a number of miniature spears, which have been made for the purpose and have been “sung.” The spears, with the bark into which they are fixed, are then flung as far as they can be thrown in the direction in which the woman is supposed to be. The party now returns to camp, [Page 417] and sooner or later, very often after the lapse of a considerable time, the woman's fat dries up, she dies, and her ulthana, or spirit appears in the sky in the form of a shooting-star."

If he be offended, then he may place in the body of the offender one of his pointing-sticks, or Ullinka, which as a general rule is a barbed stick a few inches in length and attached to a string, the malicious pulling of which causes severe pain, and the stick can only be removed by the aid of a very skilled medicine man."
t0479 cite0102 OJ29 "Magic: the relation between spirits and man . Having discussed spirits and man we may now inquire into the nature of communication between the two. We have already dealt with the guardian spirit institution which enables almost everyone to make contact with the spirits. Nevertheless there are more formalized relations between spirits and men which are carried on by special individuals. While all death and sickness are regarded as caused by evil spirits—wealth, success, and health may be brought to an individual by his guardian spirit. To manipulate the spirits of both types one has to command knowledge of the formalized behavior that is believed to control the spirits and sometimes be able to accomplish the desired task even without their help. Such formalized behavior is called magic and the specialists in it are shamans and sorcerers. The first term is applied here to a man using “white magic,” the latter to an obnoxious individual employing “black magic” for selfish reasons. The Kapauku also make the differentiation, calling a shaman “ kamu epi me, white-magic-know man,” and “ kego epi me, black-magic-know man.”"
t0479 cite0102 OJ29 "Shaman.—A shaman, or kamu epi me, is always a middle-aged man or woman, in good health. An old, weak individual shows by his physical condition that he cannot take care of his own health, and certainly cannot be helpful to others. A young individual, in his or her “teens,” would lack the experience necessary for successful performances. All the shamans the writer saw were healthy, muscular, athleticlooking people, usually rich and successful in their economic and political pursuits. Personal success is proof to the Kapauku of a man’s power. How can a man who is not capable of acquiring good health and financial prosperity for himself help others to the same things? A shaman must also be a fast talker with a convincing voice and respectable behavior. He commands spiritual powers which an ordinary man lacks. He usually has more than one guardian spirit. To be a shaman one must have as helpers not only souls and tene of the dead relatives, but also an important spirit, as for example Tege, the horrible demon of the woods, Madou, the water spirit, Ukwaanija, the wife of Tege, or Makiutija, the ghost of the earth. These spirits are effective as helpers not only for chasing away other evil spirits but, by having power over them, the shaman obviously can cure a man whose sickness has been caused by one of the species he commands. Thus a Kapauku looks for a shaman helped by Madou when he believes the latter is the trouble-maker. Ijaaj Ekajewaijokaipouga [Page 25] of Aigii, the headman of the Ijaaj-Pigome confederacy had five departed souls and tene, and twelve different evil spirits as his helpers. Being an excellent speaker, muscular, healthy, very rich, and a political leader as well as a brave warrior, he was considered one of the best curers in the valley."
t0479 cite0102 OJ29 "The profession of shaman is open to everyone irrespective of sex, position, or age. Nevertheless, only individuals with the above mentioned qualifications tend to be recognized by the society. One becomes a shaman not by learning but because of the power that comes through dreams and visions in which one acquires spirit helpers and is taught by them specific cures. Dreams also tell the shaman the nature of the disease of a particular man and prescribe a suitable cure. The society recognizes a man as a shaman when he performs several successful cures and tends to have the above mentioned characteristics. A shaman has no supernatural powers himself. The cure is performed for him by his spirit-helpers. They tell him the formula in dreams, or they possess the shaman and talk through his mouth in a high-pitched voice and like a machine-gun that is firing. Other people listen to the talk and interpret it, the shaman in this case acting as a medium. The advantages associated with shamanism lead everybody to envy the lucky man. He is most respected. From his activities, he derives only friends and no enemies. For a single cure he is paid from two to six true Kapauku cowries. His political and legal authority, if he happens to have any, become more prominent with his success in the field of magic..."
t0479 cite0102 OJ29 "The above elements are used in the categories of magic which follow. Shamans differ in the selection of elements and in their own peculiar choice of the wording of a magical spell, of the way they use their bows and arrows, and of repetition and sequences of the techniques. They also differ in eloquence and knowledge of the lore, and in the selection of paraphernalia."
t0479 cite0102 OJ29 "Preventive magic is used when one man suspects another individual of sending an evil spirit to kill him. He prefers having the magic performed prior to the onset of the disease. The procedure is almost exactly the same as in magic used for the curative purposes described below."
t0479 cite0102 OJ29 "Curative magic is used after a man has been attacked by an evil spirit which tries to scare away the soul. The shaman tries to expell the spirit by bribing it with offerings and frightening it away by his power. This type of magic is the most common of all the categories discussed. All the techniques and the general sequence outlined above are employed. At the end of the process, the shaman makes recommendations about the continuation of the treatment of the patient. He may suggest another practitioner. Very often he asks the sick man for an expression of generosity as a condition for complete recovery. This is usually a pig-killing and free distribution of the meat to the public. The sick man may also be requested to set aside a certain quantity of cowries for his son’s inheritance."
t0479 cite0102 OJ29 "Counter-magic takes place when a man is believed to be a victim of sorcery. The objectives are twofold. Not only should the patient be relieved of the spell and rid of the evil spirit but counter-magic should be used to send back the evil spirit to kill the sorcerer. Since this is considerable to ask of a spirit, the performance is more elaborate, the bribes are more numerous, and greater generosity is required. Kapauku call this type “ kego ekig[unknown]ai, to untie the black magic.”..."
t0479 cite0102 OJ29 "Magic for economic profit, such as earning much shell money and thus gaining prestige, is used by the giver of a pig feast at two occasions. One is the day when the people gather to start the construction of the dance house and the other the night prior to the putu duwai naago, the day when pigs are slaughtered and the pork sold. At both occasions the magic can be divided into two parts: a prayer by the feast owner to Ugatame, to his guardian spirits, and to his own soul to make the feast a success, thus bringing him much shell money and prestige; and the magic performance itself, consisting of an offering of rat’s intestines to influence the “flow of cowries.”"
t0480 cite0102 OJ29 "In the above case, the relationship is activated only by the spirit while the tree is just a passive phenomenon. Nevertheless, there are plants in the Kapauku universe which are active and affect the spirits rather than vice versa. Some plants, already discussed, are traditionally associated with certain species of spirits and are believed to have some power which controls them. By the shaman’s manipulation of these plants, the spirits are induced to obey the wishes of the expert. Ude kopa and jukune, another Ti plant, occupy a special position among the plants mentioned because both have a generalized power which controls most of the supernatural beings and compels them to help with white magic in case the first plant is used, and with black magic if one uses the second."

Counterspells are also known; chemical poisons obtained from elsewhere are thought to be prevalent. In addition, magic spells are chanted for many other desires, such as control over the weather, love, beauty, carving expertise, yam gardening, and sailing. Mission teachers have not disrupted the strong beliefs and practices of magic. Recently, villagers from two hamlets have introduced a new fundamentalist religion whose tenets negate the practice of magic."

t0482 cite0104 OL06 "Almost every death that occurs is believed to be the result of sorcery ( bwagau ) effected by a specialist who chants magic spells into the victim's betel nut or tobacco. Villagers chew betel and smoke in addictive ways, and these objects, which they continually take from each other, are used as the agents of illness and death. Only when a person is very old and dies while asleep is death considered “natural.” Then villagers simply say, “His time was up; he lived a full life without angering anyone.”..."
t0483 cite0104 OL06 "Flying witches may attack a person at any time, but dark nights are especially dangerous. Therefore, on moonless nights, most villagers pull their doors tightly shut and go to sleep early, whereas when the full moon ascends people move freely about until quite late and young people's laughter rings out into the early morning hours. Dark nights intensify villagers' fears, for they also believe that plans and payments for sorcery are made at these times, often at some specially arranged place in the bush so no one else is witness to the meetings. A specialist can refuse a person's request to perform the magic, and sometimes he even will warn the intended victim. Planning sorcery through someone else has its own dangers. Only those who know the magic spells have the power to act autonomously."

When he said he had none, she told him to wait for her. She went over the side of the canoe and returned half an hour later with a pack of cigarettes. He was very attracted to the girl. When she asked that they “marry” he quickly agreed and they made love on the canoe. Afterwards the girl ordered him to tell no one. She also asked him to return to the same spot the next night, promising that he would catch many fish. The next night he returned and slept with the girl again. Afterwards he began to go crazy. Each night he went out to meet the sea demon. By day he gave away the many fish he caught. His people went looking for him and found him on another island, but his words were crazy and he spoke out loud to himself. They took him back to his home island. His stomach swelled up as if he were pregnant. Local medical treatment failed to help and he was taken to a well known curer, an expert in massage, on another island. There he finally told about himself and the girl. That night the sea demon returned and asked him why he had talked. She said she would kill him. A day or two later he died."

They dragged her back to the island but she died the same day."
t0485 cite0105 OR19 "As we shall see, use of knowledge is also typically conceptualized as a contest or battle between the power of the expert and whatever he is seeking to control, whether this be a person, a storm, a disease, or a building. If the knowledge works, it is a triumph for the expert; the phenomenon he has controlled is described as having “lost to” or “feared” the expert and his knowledge. Because of strong thought, experts want to match or outdo the accomplishments of those who practice the same specialty. Not only do rivals compete indirectly over their reputations for success, they may also come together for a direct “fight with knowledge.” In these showdowns, as when two specialists engage in a sorcery battle, the ideals of competitive strong thought and aggressive bravery reach their peak expression."
t0486 cite0105 OR19 "The fighting expert knows a series of secret judo-like holds, sometimes referred to as “Trukese fighting” ( fiyuuwen chuuk), each of which renders an opponent helpless, allows the expert to throw him to the ground, or injures him. As a master casually observed while teaching me one technique, “Here it is best if your opponent’s arm breaks, it is number one if his arm breaks.” Many techniques are designed for use against an assailant who is armed with a particular weapon such as a knife, a machete, a pair of sharks teeth knuckle dusters, a club, or a spear. One of many holds that can be used against a knife wielding attacker goes as follows:"
t0486 cite0105 OR19 "The expert ducks away to the left when his opponent slashes at him, catches his wrist, and throws his weight downward as he pivots around behind him. Reaching between his opponent’s legs, he transfers his grip on the other’s wrist and stands up, jerking the other’s arm up with him. This sequence, performed in one fast-flowing movement, leaves the expert standing upright behind the assailant who is helplessly bent over, his arm extending back between his legs in the grip of the expert. Having relieved his opponent of his knife, the expert now has several choices. By pushing downward on the other’s back and pulling his arm, he can drive him face first into the dirt. Alternatively he can drag him about and torment him. This is considered a particularly useful hold when confronted with two or three attackers. If the expert [Page 142] catches one of them in it, he can swing him around easily and ward off attacks, attempts to stab the expert are likely to be received by his victim."
t0486 cite0105 OR19 "While knowledge of holds is the basis of an expert’s power, the true master has the mental concentration necessary for using them effectively in a dangerous situation. When he teaches an apprentice, an expert tells his student that a person with “right thought” ( ekiyekééch) and five holds is the master of an opponent with one hundred holds. As a fight develops, he tells his apprentice, the “first born feeling” will be fear. However, with right thought this will give way to the “next born, bravery”. He says that a person’s fear arises from concern about injury or death, attachment to his people, and anxiety over their fate should he die. What must be done, the expert says, is to “throw out” such thoughts and think instead, “So what if I die?” ( meyit ika wúwa máánó). With this attitude, “You will not die, you will be able to perform the techniques that you know, and you will destroy your opponent.”"
t0486 cite0105 OR19 "Fighting knowledge is held in great respect, and it is taken for granted that an expert can defeat a number of stronger enemies. When threatened by a knife-wielding opponent, he may threaten him in return, “It is impossible for me to be injured by your knife, but you, you will be felled by my knowledge.” However, a reputation for prowess can lead an expert into many conflicts, because other experts will seek him out in order to test their power against him. Ideally, the challenger visits the expert, offers a respectful greeting, and humbly requests they fight. The expert should politely deny much knowledge but agree to fight. He may also politely decline, but this can lead to a loss of prestige. Sometimes a challenger makes an arrogant request or, feigning anger or drunkeness, simply attacks. When a fight starts, others will try to determine the expert’s techniques by studying his movements. This is difficult, partly because of the speed with which they are executed."
t0486 cite0105 OR19 "When a master gives his knowledge to an apprentice, it is said that he accompanies his pupil into all his subsequent conflicts. The competition between rival masters extends into the relations of their students. If his student loses a fight, it is [Page 143] a loss for the master as well. There are several elaborations of this idea. Instead of instructing a single apprentice secretly out in the bush, an expert may start a fighting school and teach a group of students together. This may extend for several weeks or even months. Because it is a public claim of power, opening such a school is arrogant. When a rival master learns that a school is in session, he may respond by taking one of his students and invading the meeting house where the school is held, a challenge which must be immediately answered. The teacher selects one of his pupils, and the two students fight it out. If the outsider is beaten, he and his master are derided and thrown out of the meeting house. If the student from the school loses, his master has lost, and the school is ended."
t0487 cite0106 OR19 "Magic is also available if more direct means are not effective in evoking a response to one’s advances. While its use was undoubtedly more prevalent formerly, love magic did not belong to the body of more esoteric lore which was reserved primarily to the master magicians and is thus still known and used today. In fact, the most knowledgeable practitioners are often women, and while it is usually discussed in terms of its use by men, as appropriate to their function as initiators of liaisons, it is significant that women also resort to it on occasion. The most common forms which love magic take are perfumed ointments which are surreptitiously rubbed on the person whom one desires, and powders or other preparations which are mixed with something the person may be induced to drink. In either case both the substances and the spells which have been said over them are calculated to arouse the desires of the recipient more or less exclusively toward the supplicant. Charms may be concealed in the clothing of a hopeful lover, which will make him irresistibly attractive; these are plaited with suitable spells from the midrib of a coconut leaf. The love for a rival may also be dissipated by magic, the objective being the rather unusual one of making the woman associate the rival with feces. Some of the spells refer to the rival as feces, and a more direct effect may be produced by mixing a little feces (not necessarily of the rival) with an appropriate plant and secreting the mixture, after reciting spells over it, in the woman’s house; after this whenever she thinks of the rival she thinks too of feces. Or a bit of feces, properly dedicated to the rival, may be put in a coconut husk and put in the sea where it will drift away with the current and carry her affection for the other man away with it."
t0488 cite0107 OR19 "Consequently when treatment fails to bring immediate relief, re-evaluation and a change in direction is called for. This is the principal reason, to the utter bewilderment of modern medical practitioners, that Trukese in-patients seek early release from the hospital whenever their condition fails to improve quickly and dramatically. 3"
t0488 cite0107 OR19 "3 It may be noted that patients are often released from the hospital after medical personnel think they have been cured, but before they have recovered their full strength. Convinced they are still sick, such patients then continue with local therapy. If they eventually recover their strength completely, the cure is attributed, not to the hospital but to the medicine being taken when all symptoms finally vanished."
t0489 cite0107 OR19 "The most important and most prestigious branch of the spirit power ‘Massage’ is the one used for bone setting which is [Page 201] known as ‘massage for blows’ ( rawan ffėn) or ‘massage for falling down’ ( rawan pėwtitiw). One of the most significant pieces of information that must be acquired by a practitioner of this branch of knowledge is all the dozens of terms used to identify the various landmarks or faan located all over the body. These terms are all secret, and novices may spend months, sometimes even years, committing all these secretly named body locations to memory."
t0490 cite0107 OR19 "Similarly, a few Trukese innovators have abandoned the Trukese paradigm for illness (which views spirit powers both as causing illness and providing cures) in favor of a modern, scientific medical paradigm for illness. To my knowledge there are four such Trukese at the present time; three of them are medical practitioners and one of them is a nurse. These people sometimes speak critically, and occasionally even disparagingly, about the notion that spirit powers can either cause or cure illness."
t0490 cite0107 OR19 "Most other Trukese are not familiar with the evidence to which these people have had access, nor are they very much aware of the alternative paradigm for which they have opted. They continue to adhere to the older paradigm, revising it when necessary to account for perceived events which would otherwise be completely mysterious."
t0491 cite0108 OQ06 "On the island of Kambara, situated fifty miles by sailing canoe from the nearest native medical practitioner at Lakemba, and 200 miles from the nearest European doctor and hospital at Levuka, the natives are still dependent upon their own methods for treating the sick."
t0491 cite0108 OQ06 "The Kambarans believe that illness and death have various superhuman causes such as the possession of the body by an evil spirit, the loss of the “good soul”, black magic, the infraction of a tabu, or the smell of a dead body. Every doctor, male or female, is a specialist in one or more of these types of illness and uses his own secret medicines which he has acquired by inheritance from a relative, by a dream from an ancestor, or by a guardian spirit through the “Water Baby” cult. A doctor holds an important position in the community, and medicine is used by many as a means of increasing social prestige."
t0491 cite0108 OQ06 "A sick person usually goes first to a diagnostician, who makes an examination by tapping the body and inserting a finger into the mouth, anus, or vagina. The diagnostician tells the patient which specialist knows medicines to treat his particular type of malady..."
t0491 cite0108 OQ06 "The cure of a case of spirit possession is accomplished by a method curiously similar to that used in psychoanalysis. The Lauan theory is that the doctor must draw a confession of the name of the spirit from the patient in order to release the spirit from his body. The doctor sees the patient every day, tries to allay his fears, encourages him, talks to him [Page 126] about the spirit, gives him potions of herbs to drink, and rubs his body with medicines. Finally in the course of the treatment, when the doctor touches the part of the body in which the spirit dwells, the patient will cry out. The doctor presses the affected part until it hurts and asks “Who is it?” and in great distress the patient calls the name of the spirit. Immediately the spirit leaves him and he begins to recover."
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Technology again comes into relation with the religious ideas of the Tikopia. The borer, it is believed, can be coped with not only by physical means but also by the power of the gods. Adzes of a size for hewing out canoes are scarce in Tikopia and each is a most prized possession. That which belongs to the chiefly family of Taumako is especially valuable. When the chiefs of other clans wish to build their canoes they invite the experts [Page 122] from this family as a rule to come and perform the work. It is an old custom since their skill in canoe building is traditional. But there is an additional reason. Their adze is believed to have the power of killing any borer that may be in the timber and stopping decay. Like other valued property it has its own tutelary deity, in this case Pusi, whose incarnation is the grey reef eel, noted for the sharpness of its teeth and its ferocity. When the adze is struck on to the wood the deity is invoked:--"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "“Thy friend, Pusiuraura"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Let it be bitten by thy sacred tooth.”"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Then, say the natives, “the decay and the borer disappear. He eats them on the instant, they vanish, and the insect dies.” Because of the power of this adze it is not as freely lent as those of lesser importance are. “It goes only with the men of their chiefly family, it is not handed over loosely, it goes only with them. It is not given to the clan, it is tapu , because it is the tooth of the deity,” said the Ariki Kafika. Before using the tool the expert, Pa Tarikitoa, dedicates it in a few words to his dead brother as former user, and to the deity."
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Acknowledgment must be made to the deity for this specific type of service. I was told that when the food portion of the expert would be given to him at the first meal he would say “Tie it up! Tie it up and carry it to the chief.” It would then be carried to the Ariki Taumako, who would throw offerings from it to the deity of the adze. If this were not done then Pa Tarikitoa himself would throw offerings, saying as follows:--"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "“Recite a formula hither Pa Taumako"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "For the food of Pusiuraura"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Light be your premier adze"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Light be the path of your adze"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Anything destructive for the timber here"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Let it be eaten by you, Pusiuraura.”"
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "Moreover, later a basket of food and a bundle of green coco-nuts were carried to the Ariki Taumako as “the payment for his adze”, meaning for the use of it. I have mentioned that the adze is spoken of as the “tooth” of the deity. I was told that if the god is angered by some action or negligence of the expert who is wielding the tool he will cause it to slip and cut his foot. Here is a special sanction for care in the work, and an explanation of accident in supernatural terms..."
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "The expert justified his position by his technical competence. He obviously “carried the job in his head” as a carpenter would say. He made his adze strokes, then glanced sideways, measuring by eye sizes and lengths and the extension of his cutting. He clearly was calculating the effect of his cut on the set of the timber at any particular spot. When the two timbers were put together for marking they were held by the whole crowd of men while he ran round with his charcoal stick drawing his line. 1 He himself began the dressing of the timber from the mark. He was assisted at first by Pa Taramoa, a son of the Ariki, who asked his advice. “Pa Tarikitoa! I shall strike on the charcoal there?” wanting to know if he should cut away the mark itself. The expert answered with an affirmative jerk of the head. “Cut.” An energetic man, he did not waste words. Pa Taramoa was told how to strike the correct type of blow by his brother, and this was confirmed by the expert."
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "In the late afternoon another ceremony was performed--the kava of the canoe. Food from a large oven was brought into the chief's house, a series of libations poured, and offerings made to the gods of the vessel and of the chief. About a dozen men were present inside, but the expert and some of the workers refused an invitation to come in. “He eats at the side of the timber; he sits and throws his offerings there,” was the comment when I asked why the expert did not enter. Such is the usual custom, it was said. The convention of work is that the expert should remain by his job. This is a moral imperative which has the general function of maintaining economic efficiency. Kindred obligations are to be at the scene of work at or soon after day-break; not to leave the work to get on with other tasks; and not to dally in eating meals..."
t0492 cite0109 OT11 "The reasons for haste can be summarized thus. There is the ritual drive--a cance in pieces is in a sense an offence to the tutelary spirits who have charge of it. There is the energy of the expert himself, who in this case was a bustling person in all his activities. Such an attitude towards work in progress is common. It is associated with the possibility of going off to another task on the following day. Claims of the cultivations and of fishing or of other woodwork may press, not least upon the expert himself. There is also the stimulus given by the chief, partly due to his own wish to see the task finished and partly, though not obviously expressed, to the fact that he will then not have to feed the workers for a further day. All this of course contradicts a popular notion that the savage treats his work like play and is incapable of haste."
t0493 cite0110 OT11 "The Tikopia word for tattoo marks in general is tau , and the operation of tattooing is known as ta tau, ta being the generic term for the act of striking. It refers to the rechnicai process involved. Tattooing is usually done by recognized experts ( tufua ta tau ), who have obtained their reputation through favourable comment passed by people upon the skilful treatment of their subjects. Such an expert is often a craftsman in other activities as well; if a Tikopia has technical skill in the handling of tools he can apply his energies in as many directions as he wishes no trades are closed to him. But an expert has often been assisted by knowledge of the art having been transmitted in his family."
t0493 cite0110 OT11 "One of my informants learn from his father and also from his mother's brother; another was taught by his grandfather, though his father also was a tattooing expert and a canoe builder. The family of a third had been tattooers for generations. His father and grandfather were noted for their skill. When I asked him if he had learnt from his father he said “Yes, but it depends also “on the knowledgeable mind.” By this he meant a certain amount of natural aptitude."
t0493 cite0110 OT11 "A person who wants to be tattooed goes to any expert he fancies. Frequently he asks a close relative to operate upon him, but he may pass over such a man and go to another. For instance, when I was there a young man. Futikena, did not go to his father's brother, Pa Tarikitoa, a well-known practitioner, but to Pa Taraoro, a man of different clan. He gave as a reason that the tapping-stick of the former was heavy, that is, the tattooing implement was struck too hard, so that the operation was painful. This he had heard from other people, he said, and so preferred to go outside the family circle. Firimori, the small son of Pa Nukufuri, had three fish motifs, one on his forehead and one on each cheek, tattooed by his father's brother, Pa Paiu. “The stupid, Pa Paiu,” said Pa Nukufuri, smiling. Pa Paiu is not a recognized expert, but was trying his hand on the lad to gain experience. Experts are not common: there were three only in the village of Matautu where I lived. One of them was Fopeni, seen at work in the accompanying photograph (Fig. 1): the others were the brothers Pa Nukuomanu and Pa Nukutauriri. They happened to be all of Kafika clan, though [Page p. 174 (b)] the dominant group of the village was the clan of Tafua--such alignment is not significant in any of the ordinary crafts..."
t0493 cite0110 OT11 "The tattooer pours a few drops of water into his tiny cup and shakes a little soot into it. This is mixed or ‘pounded’ with the stem of kau[unknown]asu wood--Fopeni told me that no other kind will do, but whether for magical or for technical reasons I neglected to inquire. The patient lies down on a floor mat. The operation is usually done in the hut of the expert but, as in the case photographed, when the light is bad there the work is done out of doors in the shade of a house. The design is roughly marked out on the skin of the patient with the paigmented kau[unknown]asu stem. The matau is also dipped in the pigment, put to the skin and the adze-blade struck with the tapping-stick. The teeth of the blade pierce the skin, a little blood flows, and the skin is pulled up a little as the teeth are with-drawn. The implement is held between the first finger and thumb and sometimes the flat end of the haft is braced against the little finger. Usually the hand is steadied by holding the three lower fingers on the mat, or on the patient, as the case may be. The photograph, taken while the tattooer was at work, shows the method. The apping-stick is held also between the thumb and first finger. The patient, stretched out at full length, holds in one hand a rag of bark-cloth which the expert takes from time to time to wipe away the accumulated blood and pigment. The motion of tapping is termed ta. The line of the design is called ‘the path’ ( ta ara ). At intervals it is touched-up or redrawn by the expert who dips the kau[unknown]asu stem in the liquid and moistens with it the matau blade. When the expert is in doubt an observer, of whom there are usually several, may assist him. “That's the line” he points, and adds “Mark it.” And the expert then sketches it in plainly. Unsolicited comment of this kind is frequent in Tikopia craft-work, and is accepted by experts for what it is worth. The pencil-shaped fatuke , sharpened to an edge, is used occasionally to clean out the teeth of the matau and make them keener by rubbing it in the grooves between them."
t0494 cite0111 SR15 "In early 1781, for example, Alabi confronted a set of beliefs that Saramakas considered simply common sense: that children born with certain unusual characteristics (e.g., albinism, polydactylism) were gods, whose mortal lives required special treatment. 76"
t0494 cite0111 SR15 "76. During the initial months of missionization, one of the Moravians described Saramaka beliefs about albinos."
t0494 cite0111 SR15 "[At Captain Etja’s village of Dosu Creek] I saw a little negro lad with rather white skin and with hair that resembled white sheep’s wool, although his father and mother were black. The negroes regard such children as young gods and they let them do whatever they want, in order not to hinder them and so that they do not leave them. I have heard that such poor creatures are born rarely and almost never live to be old. When they do become a little older and something dreadful occurs, then they commit suicide. They are then not buried like other people but are thrown into deep water, so that they can return unhindered to the place whence they came. (St 3, pt. 1, 87-88)"
t0494 cite0111 SR15 "Saramakas call albinos wéti-gádu (literally, “white gods”) and consider them, as well as children with “red” hair, to be closely associated with tone water spirits. Brother Riemer described how some of these children were prepared to be ritual specialists:"
t0494 cite0111 SR15 "If nature distinguishes a youth by something special, for example unusual facial features, a long nose, a pointy chin, unusual height, red hair, or something of the like, then he is destined for special training, and from childhood he will be put under the supervision of a famous witch doctor, who will teach him the art of herbs and all the other great mysteries of his art. Such a man [is like] a born miracle worker. (St 3, pt. 2, 265)"
t0494 cite0111 SR15 "Saramakas also distinguished other “special births.” For example-as throughout West and Central Africa-twins were considered gods and (along with their parents, as well as the child who followed in the birth order) were subjected to complex rituals from birth to death (see R. Price 1983a, 60-61)."
t0495 cite0112 SQ19 "Very often, one or more of the adult men in a maloca group will be recognised as a specialist in some aspect of ritual. Some men are specialist dancers ( baya ) who have a large repertoire of dance-songs and who know well the complicated steps and movements associated with each dance. Others are specialist chanters ( yoam[unknown] ) who can recite in detail the traditions of origin of the group. These men act as leaders for the long sessions of chanting, involving all adult men, that form an integral part of communal rituals. Very often these two roles overlap so that specialist dancers are also chanters and vice versa. A third specialist ritual occupation relates to shamanism. Amongst the Barasana, there is no absolute difference between those men recognised as shamans and those who are not. At the lowest level, most adult men have some abilities as shamans and will carry out some of the same functions as those men who have a widespread reputation for their powers and knowledge. The most common function that shamans perform involves the treatment of food and other things by blowing spells. The breath is believed to be the manifestation and seat of the soul or spirit ( [unknown]s[unknown] ). By controlled breathing, accompanied by muttered spells, the shaman can direct the power of his spirit or soul towards a specific end. Blowing not only has curative and protective power, but also imparts life force and can change the state of being of a person or an object. 5"
t0495 cite0112 SQ19 "The Barasana have a verb base - that covers the activities of shamans in general. I have translated this as ‘blow, blowing’ as this action is a common feature of these activities. In many respects this closely parallels the Akawaio concept of taling discussed by Butt (1956)."
t0495 cite0112 SQ19 "All foods are ranked into a graded series of relative danger; at one end are such things as mother’s milk, at the other certain large species of animal and fish which are most dangerous of all. After birth, each new category of food that a person eats must first be rendered safe by a shaman who blows spells over a sample which is then given to the subject to eat. By about eight or nine years, a young boy or girl will be able to eat all but the most dangerous categories. After initiation or first menstruation, the person must start again from the beginning of the series and it may take three or four years before they can eat all the foods of a normal adult diet. Birth, menstruation, snake bite, illness, death in the community, participation in communal rituals and a number of other factors will all render specific categories of individual subject to danger from specific categories of food which must be treated by a shaman prior [Page 33] to consumption. Most adult men know the requisite spells for the treatment of the less dangerous foods, but only a few, the most powerful and knowledgeable, are able to treat the most dangerous categories. In similar fashion, most adult men know something about the curing of minor ailments, but very few know how to cure serious illness. There is a graded series of curing techniques and only the most widely known shamans know all of them."
t0495 cite0112 SQ19 "Shamans are thus ranked according to their knowledge and abilities. Their powers are founded upon their knowledge of myths. Most adult men know a considerable number of myths but shamans differ from the rest in two respects: first, they know more myths, and secondly, they know and understand the esoteric meaning behind them. In the hands of the shamans, myths are not merely sacred tales or stories, but things with inherent power, and it is upon these myths that shamanic spells are based."
t0496 cite0113 SF05 "The urine of the cow, or that of a black she-burro, is taken to cure jaundice. The urine of the skunk is thought to blind human beings. Human urine has many medicinal uses among the Aymara. Newborn babies are given spoonfuls of human urine (especially that of young children) until the milk appears in the mother. Fermented human urine, tamata , is also widely used. Every house has its yuru ( tamatutu or tamat waku[unknown]la ) or pottery jar for saving urine; compare Bertonio (Vol. 2, p. 81) “Chillami: Orinal como bacinilla o mate.” When a person gets the mange, they say that he is ora[unknown]en katxata , “caught or [Page 175] fished by the earth”; washing with tamata or “orina podrida” is one of the best cures for this disease. For this term, compare Bertonio (Vol. 2, p. 238) “Ttamatayacca: Orines podridos.” Aymara women wash their hair in fer mented urine, as it is said to kill fleas, lapanaka , in the hair, as well as to “cut” the grease because of the ammonia in it; very dirty and greasy clothes are also sometimes washed in tamata . When a person has a fever, he is washed all over with fermented human urine; Garcilaso (bk. ii, ch. XXIV) says that when a suckling was feverish, it was washed in urine in the morning, and if they could obtain some of the child's own urine, it was given to it to drink. As has already been mentioned, urine is also mixed with other substances, notably with the viscous pounded mass of the berries of some of the American mistletoes ( Phoradendron spp., Loranthaceae) as an ointment. When a glandular or goitrous swelling is adjudged to have come from contact with the spittle of a frog, the place is washed with tamata and salt. When a baby is sick, the mi[unknown]lu[unknown]cana ceremony may be performed by the yatiri (one type of Aymara medicine-man). A piece of mi[unknown]lu or alum is put on the child's chest and left there three or four hours until night. The yatiri then rubs the mi[unknown]lu all over the little patient's body, after which he puts the stone into a large bowl of tamata . This is then covered with a [unknown]lih[unknown]la or other woollen cloth and left for twenty minutes to half an hour. When the bowl is uncovered, the mi[unknown]lu is seen to have swelled up like a sponge (from the chemical action), usually into figures which the yatiri is able to study for his diagnosis. Then he says: “This child was frightened at such-and-such a spring,” or “He will get well,” or “He will die.” When the augury is bad, he takes a knife, and cuts the spongy mass with appropriate exorcisms, makes a hole in the ground and buries it. This diagnostic technique is of course especially valuable for the ailments of children, who cannot be expected to verbalize about such abstruse matters with any fluency; the same technique, however, is also used in the case of adult ailments, when the cause of the disease baffles even the yatiri . Finally, urine has a therapeutic value in the apsuyasiña type of counter-witchcraft. In this the house of the sick man is carefully searched and sounded for hollow places with a weavingbatten, and when the place where the sickness is hiding is found, the [unknown]camakani or [unknown]camakiri (other kinds of Aymara medical practitioners) throws some of the sick man's urine on it together with salt, and sometimes with other substances. The sickness then enters the urine and salt, which is then gathered up and thrown into a river, or burnt at a cross-roads, where the next unfortunate passerby will become the “host” of the disease. Best of all is for the [unknown]camakani to obtain by stealth some of the urine of the rival witch who is causing the disease. The sick man is bathed in this urine, which is then thrown surreptitiously outside the witch's door. In this way the witchcraft-induced disease “comes home to roost,” where it belongs."
t0497 cite0114 SF05 "Diseases and medicines.--Curing is an absorbing interest of the Aymara . Its elaborate development is reflected in the extensive terminology of diseases, medicines, practitioners, and curing techniques. It is recognized that people of different ages are susceptible to special ailments. All adults have some knowledge of simple herbal remedies and treat slight injuries; a doctor is not consulted unless the ailment or injury is persistent and specialized knowledge required."
t0497 cite0114 SF05 "Diseases are thought to be due mainly to evil spirits and witchcraft, although a few are attributed to natural causes. All the latter are classified as hot or cold and require a remedy of the opposite temperature. These concepts of hot and cold may come from Spanish influence. The general procedure is for the practitioner to divine the cause of disease according to his particular method, and then to cure it by medical or magical techniques."
t0497 cite0114 SF05 "Beliefs about the cause of disease are numerous. They include seeing ghosts, the soul becoming lost or having been kidnapped by evil spirits or witchee, dreams, being looked at by evil spirits, intrusion of an object into the body, mutilation of one's effigy in witchcraft, and the “evil eye,” the last possibly being a Spanish concept. Most of these have been discussed earlier in connection with witchcraft and supernatural beings. Soul loss, an ailment particularly common among children, results from fright or shock. If the child's mother is unable to make the soul return by calling to it, a doctor makes an image of the child's clothes, entices the soul into it, and places the image in the child's bed (Paredes, 1936, pp. 116-17). The intrusion of a fragment of human bone into the body is the cause of “chullpa sickness,” which comes from witchcraft or malevolent spirits which inhabit ruins. The bone is extracted magically in a variety of ways, but is not removed by sucking."
t0497 cite0114 SF05 "A great variety of medicines are taken both internally and externally. Most are vegetable, the roots, seeds, leaves, and flowers being taken for specific purposes. One or several plant species may be combined in a given medicine. Remedies of animal derivation, next in importance, include various portions of mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, larvae, insects, starfish, sea urchins, and mollusks. Minerals rank third as medicines, mercury being used to treat syphilis and certain clays to stop internal bleeding. Last in importance ranks human flesh, desiccated bits of which are eaten to cure ghost sickness."
t0498 cite0115 SF05 "The categories of experience encompassed by the special status designations paqo, yatiri, qolasiri , and the like may best be understood in terms of certain central preoccupations of the Aymara that are cited in an earlier section: (1) concern about disease; (2) concern about the future and the explanation of misfortune; (3) concern about the evil intentions of other human beings. These apprehensions, it was pointed out, are not entirely independent, but instead are intimately linked."
t0498 cite0115 SF05 "The preoccupation of the Aymara with disease is very striking. Nearly all laymen have considerable specialized medical knowledge and are constantly doctoring themselves for real or imagined ills. 1 In addition, the variety of professional doctors is so considerable that La Barre was led to observe:"
t0498 cite0115 SF05 "... no other primitive group known to modern ethnology has such a rich specialization among practitioners of native medicine. 2"
t0498 cite0115 SF05 "But while this elaboration of specialization has been generally recognized (indeed, it is inescapable), it would appear that etiology of disease according to Aymara theory has been highly over-simplified. Paredes states flatly that “witches” directly, or demons acting at the behest of “witches,” are responsible for all diseases. 3 Taking a similar position, La Barre writes that disease is inevitably caused either by “witchcraft” or by evil spirits. 4 Either [Page [p. 220 b]] these views are over-simple, or the disease theory of the Bolivian Aymara is considerably less complex than is true of the Aymara of Peru. In Chucuito, as has been shown, some diseases are clearly due to sorcery, either directly or indirectly. Others, however, are sent by spirits of their own volition (because they have been angered or slighted), or by permanent and naturally malevolent demons. Still others are contracted from souls and ghosts. Some ailments stem from accidental soul loss, while in others soul kidnapping is the cause. Still others, chullpa sickness, for example, result from the intrusion of a foreign object, either through carelessness or through the evil machinations of humans or demons. In addition, some diseases are unquestionably attributed by the Aymara of Chucuito to natural causes. 5 Among these are various ailments that are (or are thought to be) attendant upon childbirth; fractures, sprains, and dislocations (including the “dislocation” of internal organs); and such common and frequent complaints as p'eqe usu , “headache,” t'uku usu , “common cold,” and [unknown]c'aka usu , “rheumatism.”"
t0498 cite0115 SF05 "Thus the Aymara believe that diseases are attributable to a number of distinct causes, and it is their theory that specialized knowledge and techniques are required to deal effectively with each. When, therefore, disease is approached from the point of view of etiology, it becomes clear that the specialization of Aymara medical practitioners is based primarily upon the nature and “cause” of the illness (real or imaginary) with which they cope, and that the techniques of diagnosis and therapeutics which any particular class of “doctor” employs are, in large part, secondary to this consideration. 6 It is the paqo who cures diseases sent by spirits and demons, or by either at the instigation of a sorcerer. The qolasiri cures [Page [p. 221 a]] diseases due to natural causes, as well as superficial injuries, broken bones, sprains, extracts intruded objects, and treats ghost sickness. The t'aliri specializes in treating dislocations, particularly the “dislocation” of the heart, uterus, or other internal organs. The usuiri administers medicines designed to speed delivery, is a “practical” obstetrician, and treats those diseases, especially aire , to which post-parturient women are thought to be particularly susceptible. 1 Although conclusive data from Chucuito are lacking, the evidence indicates that the laiqa cures, as well as “causes,” some diseases, and practitioners of this class are believed to have the power to cure certain types of paralysis and insanity. 2 Although the yatiri apparently performs no cures and has no special knowledge of remedies, he is consulted frequently in cases of illness in order to ascertain the cause (whether sorcery or otherwise), and is able to divine whether a patient will die or recover."
t0498 cite0115 SF05 "Viewed from the standpoint of etiology. Aymara medical specialization is rigid; apparently no practitioner feels qualified to step out of his special province to cure diseases due to factors over which he has no control. Thus when Informant 45, himself a paqo , was seized with a stomach ailment ascribed to “natural” causes, he summoned a qolasiri to diagnose his illness and to prescribe the proper remedies. Similarly, Informant 64, a qolasiri , sent a patient who was suffering from a stubborn illness to Informant 109, a paqo , because of his conviction that the disease had been sent by a supernatural being. Informant 66, on the other hand, practiced both as a qolasiri and as a paqo . Further, albeit less formal, specialization within particular branches of native Aymara medicine may be noted. Although both Informants 64 and 65 are classed as qolasiri , the former is noted as a “bone specialist” and for his treatment of sprains and dislocations, while the latter specializes in a particular technique of diagnosis, and in “internal medicine.”"
t0499 cite0116 SP08 "That knowledge is highly valued among the Bororo is substantiated by the fact that the chief of a village is always the most knowledgeable man. Social status and functions are connected with particular lineages and transmitted matrilineally, but the true influential leaders and authorities are the men who excel in knowledge; i.e., they know the myths and songs and their meanings; they know the exact sequence of rituals and the important sacred and secret names of things."
t0500 cite0117 SM04 "Religious and bureaucratic political leadership demand fundamentally different talents. Whereas the tamoí must be thoroughly knowledgeable of Chiripá life and relations with the supernatural, the cacique must understand the mestizo life-style, language, and goals. The difference is clear in the opposing concepts of marandú and letrado . Letrado literally means “literate,” but connotes a sly self-interest, the capacity to understand the unspoken motives of others and smoothly move for one’s own advantage. Caciques need to be letrado to match the self-interested individuals of mestizo society."
t0500 cite0117 SM04 "Tamoí and caciques have fundamentally different power bases and thus, [Page 121] fundamentally different roles within community life. While tamoí focus their efforts on the formation and maintenance of the Chiripá community, caciques dominate the community’s relations with external society and the Indian community. The cacique still has little power to act on his own behalf."
t0500 cite0117 SM04 "The position of political leaders is fundamentally conflicted. On one side, the individuals are closely tied to Chiripá communities through kin relations; on the other, they are representatives of and responsible to mestizo patróns and caudillos. In one classic case, a famous tamoí who asserted himself as both a capatáz and dirigente lost credibility through his associations with mestizos. Indians who knew him in the yerbals remember that “he sold his people” and Cadogan (1959a) wrote that his later attempts to move his community were construed as a capitulation to the government."
t0500 cite0117 SM04 "Despite the appointment of political officers to manage relations between Guaraní and the larger society, the noncoercive leadership of religious tamoí remains the central focus of Chiripá communities. Appointed political leaders rarely assume a position as caudillos over their communities."
t0501 cite0118 SM04 "In any case, among the Guaraní too the belief that sicknesses, at least the majority of them, are explained by the bad intentions of knowledgeable persons and bearers of magic resources predominates. Thus the appearance of an epidemic or even of a series of cases of sickness in the same village and in a short space of time can cause important social consequences, generate distrust, misunderstanding, or even open enmities and fights within the local group, putting into action disruptive forces of social life existing in a latent state. It is even possible to state that the mystical sense of solidarity, which, although it does not unite the whole tribe and not always the individuals of a certain horde, makes the populations of the different villages cohesive, rarely suffers dissolution of continuity, except for the atmosphere of insecurity and discontent that dominates all in situations of this nature. 128 This is a supposition made, of course, concerning villages that do not already find themselves in a state of open social disorganization through continuous contact with civilization. After the epidemic is past, there is no delay in re-establishing the normal equilibrium, and the authority of the doctor-sorcerer, who has used the magic and religious resources, or that of the capitão, who has made use of his police authority in order to normalize the situation by fighting the opposing forces, then is subject to considerable increment."
t0501 cite0118 SM04 "One of the disruptive forces most characteristic of Guaraní society is the constant suspicion of practices of black magic within the group. There is not much exaggeration in the statement that [Page 165] the fear of being the victim of practices of this order is a daily preoccupation of every Guaraní. Some present-day groups reach in this sense, at certain times, a state of profound collective exasperation in which everybody believes himself threatened by everybody, a situation which is explained in large part by the acculturative crisis, and in particular, by the state of “deprivation” and misery, as well as by the deplorable conditions of health in which they live."
t0502 cite0118 SM04 "It is well known that the phenomenon of cultural disintegration, as the product of interethnic contacts, is manifested, among other things, by the parallel acceptance of two or more solutions for the same problem, of various concommitant elements with the same function, it falling on the individual from case to case to decide in favor of this one or that one. It is in relation to sicknesses and to their treatment that such a state of affairs is revealed with special clarity in Guaraní life. This perhaps primarily because of the focalization, more and more accentuated, that the sickness, real or imaginary, comes to have in the Guaraní mind, undoubtedly in consequence of a psychic flight before an unsatisfactory reality, the fruit of a state of constant frustration. And as the traditional patterns of the culture do not offer elements considered sufficient for facing the problem thus created, there is also recourse to others of foreign derivation. The ideas about the ontology and etiology of the sicknesses, as well as about the methods of cure, thus cease to constitute an integrated whole, but form a conjunction of disparate elements, so to speak. The culture seems to lose one of its primordial functions up to a certain point, that of providing the group and the particular individuals with the resources for sure and satisfactory control over phenomena that go beyond the simple biological reaction. Ideas, beliefs, and explanations of diverse origins, and arising in cultural contexts of different types, strike against one another in the minds of these poor people, producing a mental state 131 of insecurity and sometimes almost of despair. Capitão Bento, former chief of the village of Bananal, suffered from malaria (without, of course, identifying the illness) and thought the ailment was due to physiological disturbances caused in a “natural” manner by some quid malignum , which in some form or other had penetrated his body. His mother settled on the hypothesis of black magic practiced by some personal enemy with the help of a picture that had fallen into his hands. For his part, Samuel, brother of the sick man, was more inclined to believe in the [Page 171] possibility of “some spirit invoked into him,” an idea perhaps of Amerindian origin, but possibly reinforced by contact with the spiritism of the civilized inhabitants of the coast. As it could not fail to be, the same insecurity is observed in the choice of the methods of cure, magico-medicinal as well as religious, and of the specialists, who are either doctor-sorcerers of the same tribe, or civilized “curers,” or even doctors possessing an official diploma."
t0502 cite0118 SM04 "The quid malignum cause of the sickness may be any foreign body or poisonous substance or of another form harmful to health, such as pebbles, seeds, ugly worms, or even fire. If in fact it has entered the body as a consequence of black magic, the doctor-sorcerer does not get to do anything about it until he discovers the one responsible, so as to attack him with countersorcery. This among the Kayová at least. If, however, the quid malignum entered the body in a natural way, i.e., without there being any unconfessable purposes on the part of ill-intentioned individuals, whether it be by carelessness, by the unfortunate conjunction of adverse circumstances, or by the manifestation of certain deities whose appearance is linked with certain times of the year, the removal can be made either by the technique of the doctor-sorcerer, by the use of appropriate medicines, by means of practices performed by the patient himself, or, finally, with the help of religious ceremonies."
t0502 cite0118 SM04 "The attitude of the present-day Guaraní, particularly that of the Ñandéva of the coastal villages, toward sicknesses and death is characterized by a peculiar combination of fatalism and -- though we say it with due reserve -- Christian resignation. Capitão Bento’s daughter was ill; her father took her to Dr. Militão, a physician of São Vicente or Santos, who prescribed a series of remedies for her. But in the end the child died. “It is because she had to die,” was Bento’s simple explanation. And Bento’s mother added: “When a person has to die, treatment is not worth anything; when a person does not have to die, Ñandedjára himself carries the person through. When it is [Page 172] not the will of God, neither doctor nor curer can turn it around.” 132 Highly illuminating words, as they make it very clear that what predominates is not the magical attitude, but the religious one. In the treatment of the sick, the efficiency of the magical and medicinal resources is only conditional -- which divests magic of one of its essential characteristics, namely, natural causality. When the late doctor-sorcerer Arnaldo -- I was told -- saw that a sick child “had a cure,” he gave it a remedy and it became healthy. But when he saw that nothing could be done, he said so at once; he ordered herb tea to be prepared, but he did not have any hope. Fiat voluntas tua /Thy will be done/."
t0502 cite0118 SM04 "It is seen, therefore, that the power of the doctor-sorcerer is subject to considerable limitation, stemming from divine will. Were it not for this, he himself would not get sick and would not die. On the contrary, the Ñandéva says, his supernatural faculties can easily become his misfortune, because to be the bearer of extraordinary magical powers and knowledge is a dangerous state. If the doctor-sorcerer to whom the auxiliary spirit communicated the prayer or magico-medicinal song does not live in accordance with the prescriptions tied to them, he himself becomes the cause of his death. It happens that he dies only two or three months after the descent of the protector spirit, “because the religion of the Indians is very strong and also very fine,” according to the words of João Samuel. This is why Arnaldo died."
t0503 cite0119 SM04 "Craft specialization among men includes the manufacture of strainer-winnowing trays and of women’s back baskets with tumplines, to cite only the more common and important ones. The making of strainer-winnowing trays is not an industry which is dying, and its practitioners are not, therefore, simply fewer and fewer. The need for this item of domestic equipment has continued among the Cayuá themselves, and its use has developed among local Neo-Brazilians, who do not manufacture their own trays. Specialization is nevertheless present, for some Cayuá in 1943 indicated that they always obtained their winnowing trays from certain others who were quite good at making them. 131"

t0504 cite0120 SC07 "In all three tribes the men who are specialists in the interpretation, transmission, and execution of religious principles, are designated by the term máma and generally they are old men who have spent many years of apprenticeship at the side of a specialist of high reputation. These men are not shamans or curers, but constitute a class of tribal priests who are highly respected. The mámas of the Kogi enjoy very high prestige all over the Sierra Nevada because they are said to have a very profound knowledge of the tribal traditions and, in particular, of the rituals which are necessary to guarantee the order of the universe. Thanks to the mámas of the Kogi the sun follows his daily round; the seasons change in an orderly fashion, and the great principle of fertility, central to all religious thought, continues to manifest itself in nature as well as in all living creatures. The mámas celebrate the various rituals of the individual’s life cycle, and also officiate at the collective ceremonials, the dances, offerings, and other occasions."

These inhalations cause them to become dazed 16 and then it is that the witch doctor's soul abandons his body and turns into an insect or a bird--usually the yulo --and goes off to alight on a tree which stands in the middle of a lake. This tree is perpetually shaking and it is extremely difficult to stay on it. A grave misfortune overtakes those who fall for they are immediately devoured by the palometas [“pirañas” - a laterally flattened, ferocious, small fish - Translator] and crocodiles which swam in the lake. If the witch doctors are expert in their art they change themselves into lizards and so manage to stay on the tree. It is supposed that each witch doctor owns a branch of that tree which is closely allied with his destiny. While the leaves remain green the witch doctor enjoys good health and is in no danger but as soon as the branch starts to wither then his troubles begin."

t0506 cite0122 MP05 "Knowledge of the higher and especially of the intermediate genealogy, can be a form of power. It would be more accurate to say that only the powerful are allowed to have the knowledge. It is considered very presumptuous for an unimportant man to talk of the higher and intermediate levels of a genealogical charter except to give his own descent line. This became very clear during an interview with an old man who is considered one of the two greatest experts on genealogy of Zä S[unknown]llase in Däräqe Maryam."
t0506 cite0122 MP05 "The old nobleman, whose homestead is 40 kilometers from Däräqe Maryam, does not actually remember as much of the genealogy of Zä S[unknown]llase as younger experts who live nearer Däräqe, in fact he is becoming senile. During an interview, the 83-year-old aristocrat at first denied that he knew anything about Zä S[unknown]llase. When he was told the first few generations as recorded from other informants, he shook with rage and demanded truculently to know who had been telling about his forefathers. After his anger subsided, the old expert demonstrated his famed virtuosity by inserting a non-functional (for Däräqe Maryam) ancestor between a second and previously third generational major sub-house."
t0506 cite0122 MP05 "No single person knows or thinks he knows more than a small part of the genealogy of a maximal house. Besides the unequal distribution of knowledge about the intermediate levels of the charter, there is unequal distribution, in another sense, of knowledge about the lowest three or four generations, inasmuch as each active member usually knows more about his descent line’s collateral genealogy than any other active member."
t0506 cite0122 MP05 "An example of both types of differentially distributed knowledge is given in Figure 13, which shows the knowledge which two men have about the sub-house of Marta in the maximal house of Wädajo. The first informant, an unimportant core member (No. 5 on Fig. 10), telescoped the charter by omitting two generational levels below Marta, and thereby making her great grandchildren her children. The second informant, who is an active open group member through his wife, included these intermediate levels. The expert knows more collateral genealogy around his wife’s descent line than the unimportant man did around his, but the expert does not know the unimportant man’s part of the charter."
t0506 cite0122 MP05 "The incomplete and differential distribution of knowledge about the maximal house’s genealogical charter leads to a certain amount of indeterminancy with regard to the active membership in a descent group. It is almost impossible to determine the exact number of open group active members of a descent group. Aside from methodological problems, which are great, there is a more fundamental difficulty.

t0507 cite0004 MP05 "The attitudes of civilian Amhara toward the sh[unknown]ifta combine fear and dislike with a strong tendency toward idealization. The sh[unknown]ifta is feared because he is a killer; if a person happens to witness him performing some act of theft or murder, he will usually keep quiet about it for fear of reprisal. He is disliked because he lives parasitically off the productive activities of others. But the sh[unknown]ifta is widely admired, on the other hand, because he possesses a number of qualities that are dear to the Amhara. He is reputed to be an expert singer of sh[unknown]illala . He is credited with unusually handsome features because, living at the expense of others as he does, he has plenty to eat and no arduous work to wear him down. Above all he is guabaz, the great Amhara virtue that embodies bravery, fierceness, hardihood, and general male competence. This is symbolized by the sh[unknown]ifta ’s letting his hair grow to the proportions of a gofare, the wildly thick hair style of the warrior."
t0507 cite0004 MP05 "The Amhara’s admiration for the sh[unknown]ifta is reminiscent of American attitudes toward the outlaw in “western” films. In the Amhara case, however, this is not balanced by a corresponding idealization of a sheriff-figure as the representative of civil order. Although a feudal lord or governor who captures some sh[unknown]ifta in his area may be admired, this admiration will be directed to his personal qualities of bravery or cunning far more than to his capacity as an agent of “law and order.” There is no feeling among the Amhara that the sh[unknown]ifta must be captured simply because he is an outlaw. Instead, a more pragmatic approach is taken: the sh[unknown]ifta is acknowledged as a legitimate social type and is tolerated at a distance so long as his killing does not become wanton or excessive. This approach, and what, in the idealization of the sh[unknown]ifta, appears to be a tendency to identify with someone who openly flaunts the norms of civil society, bespeaks a relatively weak commitment to the value of civil order."

With a little practice the man who worked the bellows became quite expert in keeping up a continuous blast.

A pharmacist in Baydhabo told me that if the medicine is accompanied by an instruction sheet in some foreign language, preferably Italian, this may be a decisive factor in helping a customer to make up his mind.

Their supreme knowledge is manifested not only in the field of medicine but also by aeroplanes, cars etc. Somalis, and Muslims generally, have instead been given the knowledge of “the next world” ( aakhiro ). While gaalo lead easy lives now, Muslims will get their pleasure on the day of judgement ( qiyaame )."

t0510 cite0123 FQ09 "When two lovers of one woman claimed to be the genitor of her child, the Saa-Katengo Kuta decided to wait until the child was old enough to show resemblances to its genitor before deciding. Since Lozi technology is comparatively simple, the kuta rarely calls for ‘expert evidence’. Most judges--and indeed most Lozi--have some knowledge of all Lozi customs, of technological actions, and of general and specialized activities such as leechcraft. Furthermore, there is no requirement that facts involved indirectly in a case should be proved, nor is there any fiction of judicial ignorance. Various judges know also the customs and practices of other tribes, and inform their fellows of these. Here, however, the kuta may call for someone to tell it what these other tribal rules are. Otherwise, there are only two situations in which I have heard the kuta ask for expert evidence. One situation is where they refer to Government doctors for an opinion on the extent of injuries. The other situation is in adultery or divorce or seduction cases, where it is alleged that one person has infected another with venereal disease--an action on which damages and a fine were imposed in 1946. Here too the parties are referred to the hospital for examination. The doctor's, or even the African Hospital Orderly's, evidence is accepted as final, and there is no questioning on it."
t0511 cite0123 FQ09 "The attempt to isolate ‘law’ from the rest of the social process is only one of a series of similar problems to which the same general rule can be applied: as society becomes increasingly differentiated, so different social processes will become increasingly distinguished. Let us take for example the long-standing controversy over the distinction between religion and magic. In the totemic ceremonies of the comparatively undifferentiated Australian tribes, there are elements which by commonsense application of our words we may call ‘magical’ and ‘religious’. Yet the ceremonies as a whole have to be considered magicoreligious. But in as politically developed societies as those of most South and Central African Bantu (such as the Lozi), there [Page 266] are priests of the ancestral-cult and there are other persons who attempt to achieve specific ends by means of medicinal substances whose operation cannot be observed. We cannot help but call these ‘magicians’. 1 The priests occupy their offices by virtue of their positions in kinship groups; they perform prescribed actions and utter certain formulae, at set times and places, with certain material objects. The magicians may be hereditary specialists but they work outside their kinship groups; they perform other actions and utter other formulae, at other times and places, with other material objects. Priests and magicians act largely in different ranges of social relations. Here magic and religion are institutionally distinct, though both may be used and intermingled in certain ceremonies. Their elements, which we detect clearly at this stage, can be traced in less differentiated societies, and it is possible to analyse their relations with one another. So it is with law. In a society as politically advanced as that of the Lozi, we find law clearly exhibited as a body of rules and a set of judgments, and we can examine how custom, morality, and religion form sources of law in both these senses. It is reasonable to assume that a similar analysis can be applied to less developed societies. Clearly these have ‘law’ both as a body of rules defining the appropriate behaviour between persons, and as judgments, acceptable to normal members of the society, in which these rules are applied to situations of dispute. The question of sanctions--of how these judgments are enforced--is a different problem, one in the field of what we call politics, rather than in the field of jurisprudence. Law as a corpus juris exists without enforcement. No Lozi describing to me the period of political change when Lozi kutas were lax in enforcing their judgments, spoke as if he considered it a period of ‘no law’."

To seal the vacuum, he closes the small hole in the peak with beeswax, using his tongue and teeth. The outside of the peak is liberally smeared with beeswax to facilltate this. To break the vacuum, the seal is pierced with a grass stalk and the congealed blood contained in the horn poured off into a dish. Two or three horns may be employed, either in succession or at the [Page 69] same time, and the amount of blood-letting depends on the doctor's decision and perhaps the client's patience, cupping horns are also employed without reference to an ng'aka or even to a lay specialist, in much the same way as aspirins are employed in an European household."

Still, Nòmò and his familiars, like the crocodile, the sheath-fish, and water serpents command a deep respect.

t0514 cite0124 MS14 "Still another area which was used as a measure of acculturation concerns treatment of disease and attitudes towards Western medicine. This area is closely linked to that of religious attitudes and behavior. There are two types of traditional Kanuri medical specialists. One is a secular specialist who deals with a restricted number of physical ailments: muscular pains, swellings, broken bones. The other is the Koranic Malam who writes out verses of the Koran on a wooden board. Particular verses are used to treat specific diseases--the verse is chosen to fit the ailment. The ink is then washed off the board and drunk as a cure by the ailing person. This cure is called alo . Between these two medical specialists the Kanuri have a great many cures for a wide variety of diseases. When asked whether they would go to a European doctor for treatment (Table XXVI), most people replied that they would go. Only seven individuals stated that they would not do so. Two of these are Koranic Malams, whose own roles in this area conflict directly with the Western medical practitioner; three are members of the Low-status group. The direct effect of the presence of the anthropologist as an agent of Western culture who cannot avoid distributing aspirins and other pills is seen in the response of an elderly kabuna who stated that he would go for treatment because the anthropologist had come to Geidam, but would not otherwise have gone."

The Kanuri feel that their traditional means of treating broken bones, bites by poisonous snakes, and jaundice (called “yellow-eye”) are effective, and this is reflected in their answers in columns 1, 2 and 3 of Table XXVII. 86 per cent stated that the Kanuri specialist was more effective in setting bones; 60 per cent said that he was more effective in treating jaundice; 89 per cent said he was more effective with snake-bite wounds. With respect to headaches, to smallpox ( baru ), and to a general complaint of internal pains ( tuno ), Kanuri treatment is not as effective. As can be seen in columns 4, 5, and 6, belief in the effectiveness of Kanuri treatment for these ailments is low: 12 per cent state that the Kanuri cure for headaches is the more effective; 19 per cent state that they believe the Kanuri cure for smallpox to be more effective; 37 per cent state that the Kanuri cure for tuno is the more effective. The expectation that for the first three ailments the Kanuri respondents would claim that Kanuri cures are more effective while for the latter three ailments they would indicate a greater reliance in the effectiveness of Western medicine was upheld."

The akombo practised to expel evils present in the form of sicknesses, besides the various akombo already mentioned, are illustrations of this."

The practitioner of the akombo and the householder in which the sickness has appeared, proceed to a stream. The householder takes up his position up stream, and the practitioner takes a black cock and touches the householder on’ the chest and back with it, and twirls it round his head six times. Then bending down he splashes the water away from the householder with the black cock, saying ‘ibo sen, ibo sen’ (evil flow away, evil flow away); then he breaks the toes of the black cock and throws it away to flow away on the water. Then he takes a white cock, and splashes water with it towards the householder saying ‘isho kondo, isho kondo’ (virtue come virtue come); and then he takes the white cock home with him."

For Korean doctors, this consists in piercing various points of the body with a lancet so as to restore the machine's natural equilibrium. There are special treatises devoted to this part of the art of surgery, the only one known to the Koreans. They even know how to fabricate models of the numan body with iron wire so as to show students the exact places where [CLXXXII] the lancet must be inserted. Under the hand of a skilled practitioner this instrument, which is exceedingly fine, may penetrate four or five centimeters deep, and scarcely any blood is lost.

t0518 cite0126 AA01 "Because geomantic theory is so complex and difficult to learn, locating auspicious grave sites is a professional specialization in both Korea and China. And because the professional geomancer’s knowledge comes from books and is supposedly acquired through laborious study, it earns him the respect of his clients. Shamans ( mudang ) and other religious specialists do not enjoy such esteem in either society (cf. Freedman 1966: 124). This connection between prestige and absence of volitional intervention relates to an argument that we develop more fully below. As we shall see, the conception of ancestors as dependent and passive beings is evident in prestigious and formal ancestor worship. The view of ancestors as active and potentially hostile is more closely related to the shamanistic belief system, which is socially disapproved."
t0518 cite0126 AA01 "Some Twis[unknown]ongdwi villagers have a rudimentary knowledge of geomantic theory. Kw[unknown]on Hae-su, for example, knew that the accumulation of water below a site indicated its auspiciousness (Yoon Hong-key 1976: 48-51; Feuchtwang 1974b: 134); but no one in Twis[unknown]ongdwi is expert in such matters. When villagers need a geomancer, they hire one from outside the community and trust his judgment."
t0518 cite0126 AA01 "Villagers’ accounts of geomancy differ from the professional’s manuals in one respect: the villagers place greater emphasis on the misfortunes than on the benefits of geomancy. The recent prosperity of one lineage family was universally attributed to the grave of the household head’s first wife, and the grave of Kw[unknown]on Po was credited with the numerousness of his descendants; but poverty and lack of descendants were far more common in the accounts of geomancy we obtained. Apparently this is one reason why Twis[unknown]ongdwi villagers usually bury parents together. Placing them in separate graves would increase the chance of obtaining geomantic benefit, as Freedman (1966: 131) and Ahern (1973: 186) suggest, but it would also increase the risk of suffering misfortune."
t0518 cite0126 AA01 "Although Twis[unknown]ongdwi residents seem more concerned with misfortunes than benefits, and although they lack the specialist’s familiarity with the intricacies of geomantic theory, their view of geomantic causality is fundamentally the same as that found in the Chinese and Korean geomantic manuals. We did not find, as did Emily Ahern (1973: 175-90) in a Taiwanese village, that the belief in ancestral discomfort and consequent intervention in the lives of descendants was a substitute for the belief in the mechanistic, impersonal effects of grave locations. In Twis[unknown]ongdwi, informants were equally comfortable with both ideas."
t0518 cite0126 AA01 "Like the professional geomancer, for example, Twis[unknown]ongdwi villagers know that the corpse must be laid in precisely the right spot if it is to convey geomantic benefits (Yoon Hong-key 1976: 60-62). A small difference can drastically alter, for better or worse, the consequences of a site. One lineage member explained that his grandfather did not deliberately make him ill, but that the precise location (as well as the timing) of his grandfather’s [Page 74] reburial caused the accident that left him with a debilitating illness. Had the corpse been buried a few paces downhill, our informant noted, he would not have suffered his misfortune. The wife of another lineage member, whose descent line seems headed for extinction, told us that “fate” could keep the geomantic benefits of a site from the descendants by causing the corpse to be laid slightly off the correct spot. Her family had moved the grave of one of its ancestors several times in the hope that a new location would enable one of her married sons to produce children."
t0519 cite0040 AD05 "There is a set of cultural values specifying which tasks are appropriate for experts and which are not. The community members exert social pressure on an individual who does a task customarily reserved for a specialist. He is said to be “breaking someone's rice bowl” (see Glossary C). The statement illustrates a basic understanding of the total system. A man earns his rice 4 by exchanging an activity and if someone else performs that activity in his place, he will go hungry. If too many people did not hire specialists, the specialists could not purchase food, and the whole system would break down. This was about the manner that several village men were able to extend the meaning of the quoted phrase."
t0519 cite0040 AD05 "I learned the extent of social pressure on transgressors the week we moved into the village. I nailed some screening over five windows in our house and this shocked many villagers. Very politely, at least a dozen [Page 148] men (not in a group) told me that Kao Mu-li in the next village was very good at that kind of work, if he was employed the job would last longer, and right now he was not busy. I immediately hired him to build my screen door and paid above standard rates for the job to make up for my inadvertent error. This price soon became common knowledge throughout the area."
t0519 cite0040 AD05 "Other similar examples were witnessed. The village barber, Liao An-pei, was seeking a wife and during our stay, built a new house with one of its rooms designated for his shop. As the building neared completion, he believed he had spent too much money. Although he had hired a painter to put one coat of paint on the woodwork, he considered doing the second coat himself to save money. Since he had never painted before, he picked up a brush while the painter was putting on the first coat and painted a window sill. Everyone in the shop laughed at him and called others to come and see Liao An-pei painting. For days afterwards, although I could detect no difference in the comparative quality of the workmanship, visitors were shown the window-sill that Liao An-pei painted. This always brought a smile and often, an additional comical remark. Liao An-pei decided to omit the second coat until after he saved more money. He explained that business men had to be extra careful. Since almost every man in the village was his customer, if they got angry, he would lose [Page 149] business. He also explained that every villager had his haircuts in a barber shop and not at home. If a man was poor, he just got haircuts less often. Although Liao An-pei had a standard price, he did cut the hair of some village indigents at a discount or even free and no one seemingly abused the privilege. This kind of contribution was common in the village for the community was in some ways like a kinship group who took care of its own members when they needed help."
t0519 cite0040 AD05 "The occupations in Taiwan which are restricted to specialists are equivalent to those termed professions or trades in America. The trades include repairmen and the various building occupations such as painter, carpenter, mason, roofer, or plumber. In America, even when these are restricted, many householders will perform these tasks in their own homes. Government agencies have even institutionalized the practice by issuing “Homeowner's Permits” which allow an individual to do restricted work on his own home although it requires a registered tradesman such as a journeyman or master plumber to do the same job in any other home than his own. The typical American does more of these “do-it-yourself” activities in his own home than the typical Sanlei villager. There is one regular exception: the householder may help his hired specialist. For many tasks, I could detect no difference in the quality of the work of the expert in contrast to that of the homeowner. [Page 150] I never observed any major job without at least one hired expert although on two occasions, there were more householders than experts on a single job: when the mayor and his son helped one expert replaster a mudbrick house; and when Liao Chin-ping (one of the village miners), his younger brother, and his son helped two roofers put a new tile roof on his house."
t0520 cite0040 AD05 "One significant type of practice involves specialists in feng shui (literally wind and water but usually termed geomancy). Geomancy is related to the Yin (negative) and Yang (positive) factors and the Five Elements: water, metal, fire, earth, and wood (Burkhardt, 1953:129-33). “Geomancy deals with the supernatural relation of geographical locations to human events” (C. K. Yang, 1967b:263). Certain geographical locations have influence on human life, negative or positive. These factors are especially important with regard to the location of tombs, building sites, and the kitchen stove. Almost all village adults are amateur geomancers, i.e., they possess rudimentary knowledge of significant elements. Moreover, villagers believe they can generalize from previous events. For instance, a house may be built right next door to a geomancer-directed house without professional consultation [Page 388] by duplicating the orientation. Since there are family burial plots, geomancers are not always used for additional burials."
t0520 cite0040 AD05 "The most frequent call for a geomancer to come to Sanlei is to orient the kitchen stove. Sanlei villagers usually consult a geomancer from Pouti but occasionally employ a more expensive one from Hsin Tien. Although the literature mentions relocation of ancestral graves if a family has great misfortune, this has not happened in Sanlei but about twenty years ago, one family removed a rock near a tomb and planted three trees as directed by a geomancer who was called as a consultant after much misfortune."
t0520 cite0040 AD05 "As previously stated, Talei Li has many excellent sites for tombs with powerful feng shui coordinates. Two of the most famous geomancers in Taipei have purchased many of these sites. They then select them for clients and also sell the sites to the clients and make a profit both on the sale and as a consultant. One village mason and two village women earn a significant part of their incomes helping erect the elaborate tombs."
t0521 cite0049 AD05 "Again, as in the case of the other three lineages, the Uis' views about the te-li of the settlement provide important clues about the nature of the group. What is interesting here, however, is not so much people's statements about their te-li as the steps they have taken to improve it. The Uis say that theirs is the te-li of the lion, and that their hall is positioned precisely right to benefit from this te-li . Yet pleased as most of them seem to be with their lot, during the winter of 1970 there were several conferences between the lineage managers and an expert on te-li from Taipei. He assured them that if they built a wall to enclose the courtyard in front of the hall, their te-li would be even better. The primary result would be that all the wealth and prestige attained by the Uis [Page 61] would be held in the group and would not flow out to other people: “As the teeth in the mouth hold in the saliva, so the wall and gate in front of the settlement will hold in our riches and good fortune and not let them escape.” Acting on this advice, the Uis used surplus funds from the corporate lands to build a high brick wall and gate across the front of the settlement. In this instance, as in others, the Uis found it very important that they were in a position to pay for this lineage project with money earned by the corporate lands. They felt that if an assessment had to be made from every household, the project would be an agglomeration of separate elements, rather than an unambiguously corporate enterprise. They always spoke of the wall (and of other settlement projects, such as the water pump and tower) as having come from the ancestors; that is, they were financed out of the proceeds from land that had been set aside as corporate property by the ancestors."
t0522 cite0056 AX04 "A second consideration [for building a dwelling] in selecting the site is the content of the soil. Rangama residents take soil samples to the astrological specialist (usually to the astrologer) who examines them from the point of view of their color, texture and taste. He then determines whether the soil can be considered auspicious or inauspicious. There are numerous prescriptions about soil content and color in the textual material available to the astrologer. Some prescriptions of this nature are given in the appended Mayimataya . Lay knowledge about these matters is not very elaborate. One notion which appears to have achieved some currency, however, is that high iron ore content is inauspicious. The astrologer can presumably determine whether it is too high by tasting the soil. If the first soil sample is not satisfactory, additional samples from other parts of the site are examined...The calculation of an auspicious orientation for the dwelling is a task which is undertaken by the astrologer or by another astrological specialist. Laymen lack the knowledge to make these calculations, although it is widely believed that orienting a dwelling toward the north is not auspicious whatever the astrological conditions. With the exception of the schoolmaster’s bungalow, no village dwellings are oriented toward the north. It is also widely believed that dwellings should not be oriented directly onto lanes of traffic. An orientation for maximum privacy is functional from the point of view of beliefs in projective phenomena such as ‘evil eye’ which have been discussed briefly in part 1 of this chapter. Further details on the influence of projective phenomena in the design of the dwelling will appear at the end of this section. There are, in addition, textual prescriptions for such orientations."
t0523 cite0127 AO07 "Individual reaction to the monk's extension of his traditional role varies greatly both within and between the lay and the religious sections of society. Some people consider it most unsuitable that the bhikkhus should be actively involved in the practical affairs of the lay world, especially when the activities in question have overt political implications, as is the case with the community development projects in deprived, and therefore potentially disaffected areas. An alliance of this nature between the government and the Sangha was felt by these people to be to the credit of neither party. Some more cynical and perhaps more realistic observers view the desacralizing of the monk's role as a sine qua non of his retaining any kind of function in modern Thai society, which they see as becoming increasingly secularized [Page 85] and where many attributes of the monkly role have already been taken over by specialists. The choice presented to the monk would appear to be that of losing any real social function whilst maintaining a semi-divine status, or of increasing his involvement with the lay world at the cost of diminishing his special prestige."
t0524 cite0060 AO07 "Ideally, a house should therefore be built with the high levels of the floor on the east, and the low areas on the western side. The [Page 162] stairway should lead to the low area but not be directed towards the west. In practice most houses are not built strictly according to the east-west axis, and deviations of up to 45 degrees to either side are common. The exact position of the home often depends on the advice of a ritual specialist who will take the topographical circumstances into account before deciding upon the direction of the house. Building along a north-south axis is generally avoided in rural regions, as it would ‘offend the sun’....If a man who wishes to build a house can ill afford the services of an astrologer, he decides for himself the exact location of the new home. At the selected spot he traces out a rectangle of the size of the floor of the future house, taking care to avoid planning the main axis of the house in an inauspicious direction. The rectangle is cleared of all growth, and great care is taken to level out the building site, and to remove all tree trunks, stones, pieces of glass and other impurities. It is believed that any such impurity interferes with the happiness of the inhabitants of the future house. When the site has been well prepared, the owner often engages a ritual specialist, either layman or monk, to pacify the spirits who may be disturbed by the building process. If the specialist is a monk, the ceremony consists simply of a profuse sprinkling of the site with sacral water whilst uttering auspicious P[unavailable]li words. However, if the specialist is a layman, a placatory gift is made. The lay ritual specialist can sprinkle the site with some sacral water, and place incense, candles, flowers and some foods on the [Page 163] earth, whilst invoking the different powers to allow the building of the home to take place....After the invocation he sprinkles sacral water on the building site, and scatters some puffed rice, green peas and sesame seed. For a period of about a quarter of an hour all ceremonial action stops in order to give the invoked powers the opportunity to enjoy the different gifts. When the specialist is of the opinion that sufficient time has elapsed, he removes the receptacles with the gifts for Phajaanâag and indicates where the first hole should be dug, and in which direction the soil should be thrown. For the decision where this first hole ought to be, he has to find out the exact position of the great serpent ( nâag). He may have to consult a handbook or private notes inherited from his teacher to determine the serpent's position."
t0525 cite0062 OG11 "The Toradja are powerless against leprous wounds. Among the remedies that are used for them are the leaves of the patimoele , an herb with little purple flowers, which are warmed and then placed on the joints. Many come to us for help with these wounds. There are also some Mohammedans from the coast who have the reputation of being able to cure this sickness. They use for this a dried tuberous plant that is imported by Chinese traders and is therefore called kasina or kajoe sina , “Chinese wood.” These tubers are cut into pieces and cooked, and the patient drinks this water incessantly; several times a day he holds his wounds in the steam of the boiling; scrapings of the tuber are also applied to the wounds. An important prescription, however, is that the patient is to bathe at least three times a day in clear running water. An [Page 285] analysis of the above-named tuberous plant has shown that its effective constituent is tannin, but this is present in such a minute quantity that not much power can come from it."

t0525 cite0062 OG11 "Another reason why the Toradja are set on the treatment with kajoe sina by a Mohammedan is because he /197/ combines with his work all sorts of mysterious things, which are impressive. With great ostentation the medical expert pronounces a magic formula ( do’a ) over the pot, and if the sick person recovers, then he ascribes this more to the power of this formula than to the effect of the medicine. Indeed, good results have been obtained from this treatment."
t0526 cite0067 OA19 "Yet this common knowledge of pedigrees is notably surpassed by that of priests and go-betweens in every Ifugao community, and among these there are a few expert genealogists who can recite interminable series of names with a speed and assurance which gives the impression that their unending enumerations of pedigrees are but utterances of names and more names, without any attempt to interconnect or to classify. However, further inquiry shows that each of these names has its well determined place in the genealogical trees that exist in their heads. Each represents a particular person of the past, who was the husband or wife [Page 360] of this or that person, the father, the grandfather, the great grandfather of these or those sons or daughters, grandsons, great grandsons... and so forth down to the present generation."
t0526 cite0067 OA19 "Furthermore, their knowledge is not confined to bare names of persons; it is associated accurately with the localities where the cited persons lived or whence they came, as well as with the latter’s social noteworthy deeds and standing. So complete is their store of facts that they can duplicate their enumeration with a long series of names of priests and go-betweens, tell what rice fields a particular person owned and in what site these lay, point out who among the ancestors made a new terrace, purchased or sold a rice field, or organized a head hunting expedition. In a word, the experts can give any information that may be of interest or use in the Ifugao community in which they are living."
t0526 cite0067 OA19 "Nor is their knowledge of pedigrees fragmentary, at least not predominantly so; for they know not only ancestors who belong to three or four particular lines of ascendance, but also almost all side lines, as long as one or another branch did not emigrate to some other locality. Such achievement is explained by the fact that in the mind of the expert, genealogies really begin with the beginning, that is, the starting point is a certain ancestor, say of the tenth generation of the past, and from this ancestor and his wife they descend through a hundred and more side lines and bifurcations to the present generation. It is easy therefore to understand that a few such pedigrees, if combined, are an almost complete census of the population."
t0526 cite0067 OA19 "How do the Ifugaos acquire that knowledge? When priests and go-betweens are being initiated by their father, grandfather, uncle or grand uncle, as the case may be, pedigrees together with all other information connected with the very names of the ancestors are taught “ex professo”, through methodical repetition. There is a good chance that an expert genealogist will form another expert, who may even surpass his master, as long as he cares to learn additional pedigrees from other specialists. Priests and go-betweens, whenever they exercise their functions, constantly keep the pedigrees fresh in their memory...."
t0526 cite0067 OA19 "Since the names of the ancestors of the first class, those who are termed “ancestors of the other side”, cannot be the same for all households, since, moreover, there are but a few priests, expert genealogists, it is necessary that those in whose behalf the sacrifice is offered inform the actual performer about the names of their ancestors or at least about the names of those who head the various lines of descent. Consequently all households must know their pedigrees, or if actually they don’t know, because they are rather young, they have to call one of their relatives who knows and who can inform the priest. Should they not do so, should they allow the priest to go on with the rites notwithstanding the fact that his initial invocation of ancestors was defective on account of lack of information, they would surely displease those among the ancestors they did not call, who afterwards, as they believe, may take their revenge by causing illness or death...."

t0526 cite0067 OA19 "To conclude this paper I cannot but affirm once more that custom is the unique and universal basis of all Ifugao law, and that in the Ifugao mentality custom would be an idle word if it were not supported by genealogies. Ifugaw laws are not written on brazen tablets or on parchment; they are not carefully filed in Capitols or some other government buildings. Yet they are declared genuine, reliable and coercive thru the genealogical trees that exist imperfectly in the mind of the many and perfectly in the mind of the few, the expert genealogists."

The procedure of one expert pottery maker is described as follows: “First she studied carefully for some minutes the undecorated form, turning it around in her hands. Then she measured hastily with her thumb and middle finger the greatest circumference of the jar. Then she drew in the outlines of the first design, which was to be used four times around the jar. After the first element was completed, she measured it and the remaining space and drew in the second element. The two together occupied a little more than half the space, so the remaining two had to be slightly crowded, but this was hardly perceptible in the finished product.” One informant commented: “If I start to paint before it is all measured, then I get nervous that it may not come out right.”"
t0529 cite0130 NM09 "This transience of physicians has been the result, particularly in the past, of the lower salaries offered by the civil service to its personnel and of the use of government hospitals by foreign-trained physicians as an intermediate step in obtaining permanent licences to practise in a province. The fact that at least two of these physicians have been in the process of securing permanent licences is known to most Six Nations with various degrees of accuracy about the actual procedures involved. This has had a very detrimental effect on the doctor's image as a skilled specialist. Because of this belief in their lack of training, the physicians who are obtained and (or) remain at the hospital for any period of time are generally thought to be inadequately equipped to cope with the medical responsibilities of the outside medical world (i.e., non-reserve white world). The physicians are consequently dubbed “second rate,” and said to be “only practising” (i.e., learning). It is further believed that they are not capable enough to be acceptable to the white Canadians and are therefore, according to the reputed evaluation of the Federal Government, “good enough” for the Indian. From this derives the not infrequently expressed belief that the physicians are using the Indian people as “guinea pigs.”"
t0529 cite0130 NM09 "Further substantiating their unfavourable judgment of the physicians' role qualifications are many factors the non-conservatives perceive in the operation of the hospital or, in other words, in the role performance of the doctors. Referral services are utilized to a great extent by the physicians, as they were by Dr. Davis in the past, but it is claimed that “if they were doing their job” this external reliance need not be so great. Since all the physicians presently on staff (and all those hired since 1950 except two certified surgeons and three in public health) are general practitioners, this dependence on outside specialists and hospital facilities is unavoidable. Even with the expanded scale of organization the hospital is still small and is not equipped with the technical machinery now available to doctors for more sensitive and extensive diagnostic and surgical procedures. As a result of the limited array of surgical equipment, for example, and the lack of certified surgeons and anaesthetists, surgery is maintained only on a very limited scale. Recent surgery has been limited to operations for hernias, obstetrics, tonsillectomies, and appendectomies, and now it is considered desirable for even these cases to be referred elsewhere."

Since Frank was away, my mother decided to part with the baby. They took him to New Oraibi, and there the nurse untied the special string that we had bound to the navel cord. This let air into the baby's belly and caused it to swell up. The Whites also cut off a piece of the little boy's penis—calling the operation circumcision—something that we Hopi would never do. The child did not live very long, of course, and they buried him in a box in the Christian cemetery without a grave ladder and without food. I did not go near, but I felt like slapping the nurse who was supposed to be an expert but who had never learned the simplest things about babies. When I saw her afterwards, I wanted to give her hell, but realized that she would probably go to hell soon enough anyway, for surely her God would never let her get to heaven."

This localisation of senior men was closely tied to the distribution of mythological knowledge, because knowledge of myths, [Page 49] totemic designs and, in particular, ancestral songs creates very strong sentimental bonds between people and places associated with the myths, designs and songs. As men grew older and more knowledgeable for particular countries, they also became more sentimentally attached to those countries. Myths and songs, being essentially nationalistic, describe countries in terms of greatly exaggerated positive characteristics -- greenness, productivity, fertility, well wateredness and so on. These idealisations also make constant reference to love of, and longing for, home by the ancestors.

Anyone unable to acquire such knowledge in this way must purchase it from its owners. 2 Where the art of navigation has been lost, astronomy, as one of its adjuncts, has also disappeared. 3 Native astronomy, therefore, has aimed at meeting the practical problems of sailors, whose lives depended on it.

t0534 cite0116 SP08 "The fact that the principal educator of a boy is his father has far-reaching consequences. Since the Bororo headman, boe eimejera , should be a good hunter, a good fisherman, a good craftsman, and above all an intellectual with great knowledge of tribal traditions, myths, and songs, and since all skills and knowledge are acquired from one's fathers and initiators, the office of headman is not transmitted matrilineally but goes from father to son. One may also become knowledgeable without having a knowledgeable father. He may receive the desired instruction from some other man, but only if he pays the man, i.e., if he gives presents of food in exchange for information. From his matrilineage, from his classificatory brothers, and from his namegiver (if he is one of his brothers) a man will inherit the right to ceremonial performances, names, and songs; but he will not be taught how to perform the ceremonies or how to sing the songs unless he pays his instructors. I quote here the words of a headman, which convey the Bororo thoughts about education:"

Quite obviously these rules had been established in the remote past, and were meant to function in a much larger society, much of it nucleated in extensive settlements and even in and around urban centers. But after the defeat and dispersion at the hands of the Spanish troops, cluminating around 1600, the details of social organization and marriage rules have largely ceased to function and have not been adapted to changing social conditions."

The presence of this pustule on the body of the father or mother causes the death of the child when the latter has attained the age of one or two years. Therefore, the parents are conducted by the members of the family to a stony open space, called a monga. They crouch on the ground completely nude, and while the medical specialists look for pustules in the hair, the members of the family make a great clamor and direct the most curious possible terms towards the mother and the father. This procedure facilitates the working of the medicine and renders the pustules more visible; because the latter are well hidden and permit themselves to be discovered more easily during the noise of the insults. Once found they are scratched from the skin with a knife. There are no other remedies."

t0208 cite0003 FO07 "I never intruded upon private conversations between Kamanga and Badobo, his teacher, however dilatory their conduct. The astuteness of the teacher would have surprised me more had it not been that I was well acquainted with the extreme credulity of his pupil, whose deep faith in magicians never ceased to astonish me, though I had daily evidence of it. Subtle procrastination might well have persuaded me to jettison my inquiry into the technique of witch-doctors in favour of other anthropological cargo had it not been for the arrival of a noted witch-doctor on a professional tour from a distant district. This man, named Bögwözu, was arrogant towards the local practitioners, whom he treated with alternating contempt and condescension. Badobo bore his conceit less easily than the other witch-doctors since he was used to the deference now paid to his rival."
t0208 cite0003 FO07 "Here was an opportunity to be seized at once, since it might not recur. I flattered Bögwözu’s self-esteem, suggested that he should take over the tuition of Kamanga, and offered to pay him munificently so long as he taught his pupil all he knew. I explained to him that I was tired of Badobo’s wiliness and extortion, and that I expected my generosity to be reciprocated by the equipment of Kamanga with something more than exoteric knowledge of a witch-doctor’s technique. To Badobo I excused myself on the grounds that this new practitioner was distinguished in his profession and had qualified among the neighbouring Baka people, who are renowned for their magic, as well as among Azande, so that he could teach Kamanga the medicines of two cultures. At the same time Badobo was to continue his instruction and receive remuneration for his services."
t0208 cite0003 FO07 "When informants fall out anthropologists come into their own. The rivalry between these two practitioners grew into bitter and ill-concealed hostility. Bögwözu gave me information about medicines and magical rites to prove that his rival was ignorant of the one or incapable in the performance of the other. Badobo became alert and showed himself no less eager to demonstrate his knowledge of magic both to Kamanga and to myself. They vied with each other to gain ascendancy among the local practitioners. Kamanga and I reaped a full harvest in this quarrel, not only from the protagonists themselves but also from other witch-doctors in the neighbourhood, and even from interested laymen."
t0209 cite0003 FO07 "There are sure to be witches among the audience, and these naturally hate the witch-doctors who are on their track. They try to make their feet heavy so that they become easily tired and cannot dance well. They try to spoil their songs by preventing people from backing up their chorus. They try to confuse the drummers so that they fail to correlate their beats with the rhythm of song and dance. Most of all, they attempt to bemuse the performers so that they cannot divine correctly. The practitioners dance with all their might against these witches and utter spells against them, and if seriously annoyed may even shoot pieces of bone into their bodies and afterwards extract them in order to show every one that they are alert. They also object to people who come and stand watching them in a superior and condescending manner instead of sitting down respectfully like the rest of the audience. They fix their eyes on these men in a ferocious stare, and unless they sit down at once shoot pieces of bone into them so that when the recipient of a shaft returns home in the evening a slight illness will remind him of his misdemeanour. When a witch-doctor has shot at a person he may walk up to him and theatrically remove his shaft, generally from the forehead when the missile is a black beetle. The man himself says that a witch-doctor has extracted a missile of witchcraft from his body. Other people think the witch-doctor has shot him because he is a witch. Every one interprets such actions as he pleases. They are not important."
t0209 cite0003 FO07 "When a witch-doctor shoots a missile at any one he does so by raising his leg and sharply kicking it out in the direction of his objective. One will often see him aim a kick in this manner towards another witch-doctor, and his sally results in a lively duel between the two. They advance forward into the dancing space, eyeing one another keenly, make a few preliminary hops, and then start a spirited duel of dancing. Suddenly one of them kicks his foot out towards his fellow practitioner who twists round with agility to allow the bone shaft to sail past him. The [Page 180] latter retaliates by shooting in the same manner at his companion, whose turn it is to avoid the missile. Members of the audience prefer not to be in direct line of fire during these bouts, lest a bone or splinter shoots past its objective and becomes embedded in their bodies. If one of the combatants shoots his opponent he walks up to him and removes his missile with evident triumph. Generally these fights are sham encounters staged in order that witch-doctors may show off their abilities before their audience, but when the protagonists are jealous of one another there is frequently an element of ill nature in the display. If professional rivalry tends to embitter the sport, a third witch-doctor sometimes dances in between the opponents, waving his hand up and down to placate them. Kamanga gained a triumph during our trek in the Belgian Congo. After a long and exhausting battle with another witch-doctor who had resented his presence in the district as an act of professional poaching, Kamanga caused his hat and leglets to fall off during the engagement by means of his magic ammunition. When a combat is a friendly duel, engaged in solely for spectacular effect, the two practitioners often walk up to each other at the end of it and shake hands."
t0210 cite0003 FO07 "In the old days, when there were very few witch-doctors, they must have been on a par with ordinary specialists in magic, differing from them only in degree and mode of specialization. A great increase in their numbers in late years and the greater spacial density created by Government settlements have resulted in a larger measure of joint activity. Some kind of initiation of a new member in the corporation has always taken place, but it can hardly have been a ceremony attended by such a strong body of practitioners as those who assist at it to-day. Communal meals, at which a number of witch-doctors gather round a fire and eat medicines together, are now a regular feature of their professional life. To-day seances are usually conducted jointly by a number of witch-doctors, and it is only princes and wealthy commoners, the conservative [Page 203] element in society, who still summon a single practitioner to dance for them. However, witch-doctors always act singly in their capacity of leeches."
t0210 cite0003 FO07 "Co-operating together in these ways tends to produce group sentiment and group machinery, but of an essentially local character, never national or even tribal. In each district witch-doctors largely act together, but normally they do not act jointly with witch-doctors of other districts. It is not the structure of the corporation which gives cohesion to all its members, but a number of separate magicians, living in one small area, possessing common magic, and acting together in a number of their magical functions, who tend in consequence to form an organization."
t0210 cite0003 FO07 "Joint local functioning tends in the same manner to produce leadership, though not permanent or institutional leadership. What I have already written about the conduct of a seance is sufficient to show that some degree, in point of fact quite a high degree, of co-ordination of behaviour is essential. The spacial arrangements of the dancing place and the mode of dancing by themselves necessitate some kind of organization and leadership. But the full functions of leadership will be clearer when I have described also the esoteric side of a witch-doctor’s life."
t0210 cite0003 FO07 "Azande have an unusually well-developed political sense, and any joint activity in which they engage takes on the pattern of their political structure. There is always a gbia of any undertaking. This word properly means ‘noble’ but may also be used simply as a title of respect to a commoner, and in this context refers to the leader in an activity. When a member of the aristocracy enters into an activity he is almost invariably the gbia, or stands largely outside its organization. When the undertaking is manned by commoners one of them will act as the gbia, on the pattern of the noble-commoner relationship, though without its full content. I have explained earlier that nobles do not become witch-doctors, so that it is always a commoner who acts as leader on the ground of age, experience, personality, achievement, and knowledge of magic. Wealth and social position also qualify a man to some extent to play a leading role, even when his experience and knowledge [Page 204] of magic are smaller than those possessed by other members of the corporation."
t0211 cite0003 FO07 "Thus, in our settlement, when Bage performed at seances he took a leading part, since he carried his political status with him into a sphere of life where he was not acting as a political agent. But the real leader was Badobo. Badobo, a man of middle age, had possessed witch-doctors’ magic for a longer time than any one else in our neighbourhood. His father had been a witch-doctor before him and had initiated him into the craft as a boy. He was tactful, but did not show any of the striking characters which usually designate a leader, and his central position among the local practitioners was derived mainly from his personal relations with each individual, since he had taught most of them their knowledge of medicines and had sponsored them at initiation. There were two or three other practitioners who were thought to equal Badobo in professional skill, but they lacked the same personal following derived from dependence of pupil on teacher."
t0212 cite0003 FO07 "When a youth applies to a witch-doctor for tuition the transference is much shorter and is complicated by payments, 1 and by the formation of personal attitudes, which have to be built up outside family and household. The young man is asked by his future teacher whether he is quite certain that he wishes to be initiated and is exhorted to consider the dangers which may beset his relations and himself if he attempts to acquire the magic half-heartedly. He will also be reminded that the magic is rare and expensive, and that his teacher will require frequent and substantial gifts. If he persists in his desire to become a practitioner the older man will consent to teach him the art. His relatives are unlikely to object if their poison oracle foresees no unfortunate outcome for the youth or themselves."

This is the order of becoming a witch-doctor that I have observed. However, there is no fixed sequence in these rites."
t0212 cite0003 FO07 "I have often observed three or four witch-doctors, and sometimes as many as seven or eight, gather in the homestead of an experienced colleague, who knows all the medicinal herbs and trees from which a magic stew is made, and there partake of a communal meal. This senior witch-doctor, who is also generally the owner of the homestead at which the ceremony takes place, has already dug up in the bush a number of roots, and scraped and washed them preparatory to cooking. He places them with water in a pot and he and his colleagues gather round the fire to watch them boil. They chat and joke among themselves about a variety of secular subjects, though the affairs of their profession are also sometimes discussed. They display no outward manifestations of awe and reverence. After the water has boiled for some time and become coloured from the juices of the plants, the witch-doctor who has gathered them and is cooking them, and whom I shall refer to as their owner, takes the pot off the fire and pours out the liquid into a second pot, which he places on the fire for further boiling. The roots from which the juices have been extracted are removed to a nearby hut, where they are stored for another occasion."
t0212 cite0003 FO07 "At this point the witch-doctors commence to rivet their attention upon the business in hand, drop their secular conversation, and develop a noticeable degree of concentration on the medicinal juices now boiling on the fire. This is the first sign in their behaviour that they are dealing with magical forces. Spells from this point accompany various phases of the cooking and continue seriatim till the end of the ceremony. When the owner is pouring out his medicinal juices into a second pot for their further boiling he generally addresses them in a few words, asking for the welfare of witch-doctors as a whole and for the success of their professional interests. He [Page 207] then divides up a ball of paste, made from oil-bearing seeds ground down with a magic root, into several small round balls, one for each witch-doctor present. The owner places these along the periphery of the pot and first he and then each witch-doctor in order of seniority flicks his ball into the pot. The owner now takes a little wooden stirrer and slowly stirs the oil in the juices, addressing the medicines as he does so, partly on his own behalf and partly on behalf of the novice whom he is initiating:"
t0212 cite0003 FO07 "‘May no evil fall upon me, but let me rest in peace. ... May men hear my renown in the kingdom of Renzi to the south and in the far north among the foreigners at Wau.’ ... When there are only two or three fully qualified witch-doctors and no novices present, each stirs and addresses the medicines and eats of them without necessarily making a preliminary payment to their owner, but when there are a large number of witch-doctors, including several novices present, it is customary for the owner not to allow them free spells, but to demand a fee from each person who par-takes of the communal meal. He tells them that he will not take the pot off the fire until every one has made a payment. Whereupon each witch-doctor produces half a piastre, or a small knife, or a ring, and places it on the ground in front of the fire or even in the pot itself. These payments must be placed in the sight of the medicines, which normally must be bought or they will not be potent. Purchase is a part of the ritual conditioning of the magic which gives it potency. I have even seen a witch-doctor who was treating a patient for nothing place a piastre of his own on the ground, and when I asked him what he was doing he explained that it would be a bad thing if the medicine did not observe a fee, for it might lose its potency. If any one fails to produce a gift the owner may threaten to leave the medicine on the fire and let it burn, or, it is said, he may sometimes remove it from the fire, but not let any of his colleagues eat it till they have made sufficient payments. The medicines are his. He gathered them in the bush and prepared them and cooked them in his own utensils. He is their owner and they must be purchased from him. It must be remembered that since magic which is not purchased in this manner is of doubtful potency it is to the advantage of the eater to pay a small fee, as well as to the advantage of the owner to receive it, for not only does payment of a fee form an integral part of the magic ritual, but also in Zande-land it is thought essential that when magical powers are [Page 210] transmitted from one person to another their seller should be satisfied with the deal, since otherwise they will lose their powers in the transference. The goodwill of the owner is also a relevant condition in the sale of magic, and his goodwill can be assured by a small payment."
t0213 cite0003 FO07 "References have been made to rivalry among witch-doctors. I described how they dance against one another at seances, and how one may try to shoot magic shafts into the body of his colleague and incapacitate him from dancing and prophesying efficiently. The rivalry between Badobo and Bögwözu runs through the whole account of Kamanga’s initiation. Further reference to these jealousies is now made, because a large number of the medicines which are taught to a novice have as their function the equipment of defensive and aggressive powers against professional rivals. There is little jealousy between junior witch-doctors, but when a man has gained a professional reputation it is certain to clash with the interests of others who have been longer established in the district. These doctors try to build up for themselves practices among laymen, and as they derive both wealth and reputation from them they are envious of the encroachment of others. In the case of Bögwözu every local practitioner of standing was hostile towards him as he was a stranger from a different locality and was considered a trespasser in their area. But before Bögwözu’s arrival there had been concealed hostility between Badobo and another witch-doctor, Alenvo, who came to live in our [Page 246] settlement from his home about a mile away, and there were the beginnings of other jealousies. The jealousy of witch-doctors is proverbial among Azande."
t0214 cite0003 FO07 "This social differentiation has its ritual side also, for the witch-doctor performs for a large number of people at a seance what each would otherwise have to do himself by means of oracles and various forms of protective magic. On these occasions the community trusts to him to look after their interests by keeping an eye on witches, exposing their intentions, and frustrating them. In all important situations each Zande uses magic for himself or pays a specialist to perform rites on his behalf, but we may think of the witch-doctor as a special agent summoned from time to time with a general commission to ferret out witch-activities in the neighbourhood and to protect people against them."
t0215 cite0003 FO07 "Azande who have seen our drugs regard them as they regard their own. Their therapeutic value is limited and lies in some mystical quality in the drug itself. Hence I could not persuade them to use even the simplest drugs as they were intended to be used nor convince them that a drug which was suitable for one ailment might not be used for other ailments. My experience as an amateur physician was that Azande would consult me about aphrodisiacs and about what they consider to be minor complaints, sores, stomach-ache, headache, and so forth; but when a complaint was serious they took serious measures to counteract it and consulted oracles and employed witch-doctors. Perhaps in my case they were wise. Nevertheless, the attitude of mind that led many of my patients to desert me for native practitioners is mystical, for they think that our drugs, like their own, are useful in treating external symptoms and may be adequate to eradicate minor complaints, but by themselves they have no effect on the causes of serious illnesses, witchcraft and sorcery, which can only be counteracted by the use of oracles and magic. Azande feel that European drugs are suitable for Europeans and Zande drugs for Azande."
t0216 cite0001 FO07 "A youth wishing to be initiated will apply to a practitioner and make him continual payments, for magic is a personal possession and is [Page 526] only efficacious when willingly given and paid for. Abinza meet and together partake in ritual fashion of their medicine; initiates undergoing training will attend these meetings and take full part in them. One of the abinza (usually a senior practitioner) who provides the meal will be paid by the participants, and this must be done in the presence of the medicine, which is thought to realize what is happening. He collects the required ingredients, recites magic formulae over them, and cooks them in the presence of his colleagues; the noviciates hold their heads in the steam rising from the pot and all partake of the medicine in the prescribed manner. Incisions are made on the chest and some of the fluid rubbed in, the residue being preserved in medicine horns. The medicine gives both physical and spiritual strength, and during a séance a medicine-man feels it stirring within him (even though he may not have eaten a ritual meal for a long time) and then begins to dance. The novice will be taught to recognize the plants from which medicines are made, and will be taken to the ravines where the most secret ones grow. These ravines, where streams arise, are dangerous places, for here Mböli broods and the atoro dwell. This was the only connection that Professor Evans-Pritchard was able to find between spirits of the dead and magic, and this according to his informants was only accidental; in these ravines the secret herbs grew, and it was here that the spirits dwelt, but the efficacy of the herbs was not believed to be due to the spirits or to Mböli."

There is no philosophical basis for the development of medical systems among the Amhara, thus no reasoned system. Their medical concepts are pre-Galen, at most Aristotelian. The debtera have, or in some cases claim to have, books handed down from past centuries, containing secret formulae, recipes, pharmacopeia of an intermingled empirical and magical nature. They warn inquirers that the public revelation of these secrets would create great social dangers at the hands of the irresponsible."

Ideally a student spends enough time with a debtera master in each subject to become proficient according to the master’s standards, and to acquire mastery of one subject so that he may, in his turn, offer instruction in it. Studies usually begin with kiyne . In the kiyne drills a boy learns Ge’ez, the language of the church, and develops the habits of diligence and concentration and the acuity of mind that are necessary for his later studies. Students consider the kiyne curriculum to be very difficult, for in addition to mastering the subtleties of versification, they must memorize great amounts of scriptural and liturgical information. Typically, a new boy is warmly received as a “younger brother,” but offers of help soon give way to competition as the established students come to regard him as a rival for the master’s personal instruction and encouragement. To be the master’s favorite means rapid advancement through the curriculum and a seat at his table. Without his patronship, a student is committed to years of physical misery, scraping to meet his subsistence needs, and paying his “tuition” in arduous and humbling ways, by gathering wood for the master’s fire, tilling his garden, and washing the feet of the master and his visitors."
t0223 cite0008 MP05 "Debtera use the term abinet to refer to recondite works which satisfy some personal interest. The efficacy of abinet is obtained wholly or in large measure by invoking supernaturals, usually in contexts beyond what the church permits."
t0223 cite0008 MP05 "Abinet subjects include (1) cures and prophylactic amulets; (2) works with academic ( timhirt ) goals; (3) works protecting property and stimulating its increase; (4) works for gaining respect, love, and favorable treatment; (5) accurate divination through dreams, (6) divinatory texts ( awdunigist ); (7) works for sending sickness and other misfortunes; and (8) techniques for forcing the appearance and co-operation of demons ( ganel )...."
t0223 cite0008 MP05 "A boy rarely begins his debtera career intending to learn abinet, and he acquires his first examples almost inadvertently. Subsequent abinet are collected gradually, as he rethinks from practical and moral points of view the differences between abinet which directly satisfy some immediate personal need and abinet which enable him to sell a service to others, and as he accumulates an effective professional capital of abinet."
t0223 cite0008 MP05 "With few exceptions, a student’s first abinet are therapies for the ailments which afflict him, and abinet to improve his memory and acuity for learning kiyne . These first abinet are generally gifts from student friends ( gwadenya ) and mess-mates ( balinjera ), since a boy rarely possesses anything beyond friendship, deference, and abjectness with which he can appeal to a potential donor. Among these companions favors are expected to be freely given and no formal accounting is made. Beyond this circle all students are implicitly rivals ( towdaderiy ). Another source of abinet at this time is some older, more knowledgeable student. Here, the relationship between donor and recipient is framed as an exchange between a patron ( radat ) and his client ( taraj ), a customary dyad contrasting power with dependency, and generosity with deference. The new boy appeals that he is abject and threatened by mortal dangers; the donor, by his gift, publicly asserts a status difference which sets him off from novices in general."
t0224 cite0008 MP05 "Second, there is a practical problem of storing the recipes’ elaborate instructions for identifying, gathering, processing and administering materia medica . While the debtera can record all this in writing, the illiterate layman has only his memory. There is another serious social obstacle that would have to be reckoned with once it came to public attention that he was engaged in this unusual activity. Interests of this sort are inevitably interpreted as evidence that the collector aspires to be a “magician” ( asmatenya ) and that his ultimate goals are antisocial ones. Finally, secular healers (particularly the expert curer, the medhaniyt awakiy ) are reluctant to share professional knowledge with other secular healers, even when a reasonable price is offered. Unlike the abinet capital of debtera, the herbalist’s medical capital dissipates as it is “spent.” When two debtera exchange subjects, neither considers the other a rival in the specialties which they exchange. Eventually, their paths are bound to part, as one or the other continues his travels. Moreover, a debtera is not known for specific works, since his public reputation rests upon his access to generic powers. Instead, he is recognized by his public as being either “strong” or “weak,” and if he is reputed to be “strong,” a potential client assumes that he is competent to treat a broad range of maladies. In contrast, the professional reputation of the lay healer is tied to a specific ailment, just as he himself is tied to a specific locality. Since a layman’s medical reputation is fixed in space, potential purchasers of his medical knowledge are drawn from among his potential clients. Thus, by sharing his medical knowledge with another secular healer, the lay practitioner establishes a potential rival and dilutes the economic and social advantages of his practice."
t0225 cite0009 MP05 "The Habe[unknown]sa hakiyms (“Abyssinian healer”) can be sorted into three mutually exclusive categories, each defined analytically, according to shared professional titles."
t0225 cite0009 MP05 "Category 1. Physical manipulation of the sickman’s person is dominant, and the employment of materia medica is either absent or subordinated to these physical manipulations. These healing powers are compatible with the first and second therapeutic strategies discussed in Chapter One. Any therapist of this category, with the exception of the awalaj (midwife), can be referred to as “ wogey[unknown]sa ”. The exclusion of the midwife is probably a sexual one, since practitioners known as wogey[unknown]sa are almost invariably male, while the awalaj is always a woman. Operationally, healers of the first category are distinguished from one another by their different organ domains---bone and jimat, teeth and jaws, tonsils and uvula, womb and associated organs."
t0225 cite0009 MP05 "Category 2. Therapeutic success relies on the use of medicaments; practitioners of this category utilize the third therapeutic strategy. Although no single term properly distinguishes these therapists from other categories of practitioners, they are, as a class, described by a common set of professional titles. Each title consists of three terms. The first indicates the name of the ailment for which the practitioner owns a therapy. Unlike other categories of practitioners, professional titles among these therapists are specific for single named ailments, rather than for a range of ailments. The second term is always the word “ medhaniyt ” (“medicament”). The maker of therapeutic amulets is the single exception to this (e.g., yidemaketir kitab kitabiy , “amulet maker for post-partum bleeding”). The final term indicates the format and “completeness” of the herbal therapy practiced. Thus, the “ yianfula medhaniyt awakiy ” is the “medicine expert for the ailment known as anfula ”."
t0225 cite0009 MP05 "Category 3. Therapeutic success derives from the practitioner’s intimacy with spirit beings ( ganel , zar , or saint of the Church) and his familiarity with magic ( asmat ); he relies upon the fourth therapeutic strategy. The term “ tonkway ” is sometimes used to denote the most prominant practitioners of this category, the debtera - [Page 30] and balazar -healers, but semantically that term tends to emphasize the practitioner’s ability as a seer rather than as a therapist. Moreover, the atmakiy (annointer) is never referred to as “ tonkway ”, even though his powers are also derived from supernaturals. When, in conversation, it is necessary to distinguish this category of practitioner (including the atmakiy ) from the “secular healer” (categories 1 and 2), the title ‘ wogey[unknown]sa ’ is extended to subsume all of the latter as a class."
t0226 cite0009 MP05 "Wogey[unknown]sas s are divided into three named categories, the tagañ , the intil korac , and the yiters medhaniyt awakiy . Practitioners in each category diagnose a set of related ailments, perform therapeutic operations to remedy them, and administer prophylaxis to prevent the development of ailments to which the therapy makes the sickman vulnerable. Laymen have little difficulty in selecting an appropriate kind of wogey[unknown]sa , since the ailments treated by each category of wogey[unknown]sa are characterized by unambiguous syndromes which are easily identified by laymen. In addition, a wogey[unknown]sa ’s range of medical competence is defined symptomatically; that is to say, his therapies are relevant to the entire range of etiological facts which can be associated with each syndrome he treats. This contrasts with herbalist therapies which are each tied to a specific pathogenic agent, so that often symptomatic information is of itself insufficient for determining whether the therapy of a particular category of herbalist is appropriate to the disease episode at hand. The following paragraphs describe the sequence of activities which characterize the professional activities of each category of wogey[unknown]sa."
t0226 cite0009 MP05 "For the layman, the symptoms of fracture ( sebero ) and therapeutically related ailments are distinctive [Page 34] enough to limit selection of a practitioner to the tagañ , bonesetter. Symptomatically, these ailments are experienced by the Amhara as 1) severe local pain and 2) the inability to move the affected areas (generally limbs, extremeties, and joints). As with other categories of wogey[unknown]sa , the tagañ ’s range of competence, symptomatically defined, is clear cut from the layman’s point of view. There are ailments not treatable by a tagañ , although characterized by one or the other of these symptoms. In these instances, however, the two symptoms do not appear in combination, but are accompanied by other symptoms which fall unequivocally beyond the tagañ ’s competence. Kofa , for example, is an ailment not treated by the tagañ , although it is characterized by an inability to move the limbs. This syndrome includes, however, high fever and generalized pain, both beyond the tagañ ’s therapeutic powers. On his arrival at the sickman’s, the tagañ conducts his own diagnosis, examining the affected area and looking for other relevant symptoms. His interest is not so much to confirm the generic character of the ailment, as to discover its specific nature (sometimes classifiable under a disease name with which laymen are unfamiliar), and to evaluate the complexities of the specific case. A fracture ( sebero ) always involves more than a broken [Page 35] bone, for jimat cords in the area of the break are invariably stretched and malaligned. It is the twisted jimat , in fact, which prevent the sickman from moving the affected area, and whose effects the tagañ knows to be symptomatically dominant. Thus, the tagañ seeks to learn whether a bone has actually been broken, whether only jimat are involved (a condition known as walemta ), or whether an organ other than bone has distorted the jimat (for example, intrusive blood in an ailment known as setir )."
t0227 cite0009 MP05 "When an incision is made, an herbal poultice is placed over the cut and wrapped beneath the splint, as a precaution against subsequent infection ( kusil ). Every tagañ owns a recipe for an unguent, and the medicaments used in it are kept a professional secret. However, not all tagañ s have recipes for kusil prophylaxis. Without the latter, a tagañ who wishes to treat compound fractures must obtain the services of an herbalist whose specialty is the treatment of kusil . Similarly the tagañ who is able to treat compound fractures [Page 37] without the assistance of another practitioner is himself identifiable as a kusil herbalist ( yikusil medhaniyt awakiy ), a non- wogey[unknown]sa professional identity."
t0227 cite0009 MP05 "Alone among Amhara secular practitioners, the tagañ practices a therapy which immobilizes the sickman for an extended period. During recuperation, therapeutic massages must continue, and the instability of the sickman’s jimat preclude his moving about. When a tagañ is famous for difficult therapies, such as breaking and resetting improperly set bones or treating paralyzed limbs, he attracts sickmen from great distances. Since these sickmen cannot leave the tagañ until pronounced cured, they require access to local accomodations and the assistance of a relative or servant to prepare their meals and tend to other personal [Page 38] needs."
t0228 cite0009 MP05 "To be sure, there are some technical differences among the practitioners of a single named specialty---in the composition of medicaments (e.g., unguents), the instruments which are used, and the numerological content of therapies---but the advantage which any of these give a practitioner is in itself never sufficient to explain his record of therapeutic success. It is rather a wogey[unknown]sa ’s manual skills as a manipulator of errant body parts or as an excisor of diseased ones which is believed to set him apart from his less successful colleagues."
t0228 cite0009 MP05 "The wogey[unknown]sa ’s numerological information indicates optimal amounts of therapy, neither too slight to produce a remission of symptoms, nor so excessive that a new undesireable condition is caused the sickman. In tagañ [Page 42] therapies, for example, some practitioners contend that the single diagnostic massage for fracture is insufficient for setting a broken bone. They claim that a massage on each of three successive days is required; two days massage will not soften the bone enough for proper ailgnment, while four days massage may distort it. Similar numerological considerations in tagañ therapies relate to the manufacture of medicaments, the duration of the splinting period, the number of days during which atmit is consumed, and the number of repetitions required by the final massage. Because these numerological elements are considered inextricably bound, sometimes diffusely, to one or more other components of a therapy, they cannot be freely inserted into the therapies of other tagañ s."
t0229 cite0009 MP05 "The Amhara herbalist recognizes that the physical condition of the patient he confronts is the product of the latter’s age and the seriousness of his current afliction, and that these circumstances impose limits on how strenuous and prolonged a therapy the sickman can reasonably be expected to endure. Since treatment must be kept within these bounds, the practitioner is expected to stop the action of the primary medicine once the pathogen has been completely removed from the sickman’s body, or after the sickman’s condition allows no more purging and vomiting. In order to stop the action of this medicine, the sickman is given a counter-medicine, known as memele[unknown]sa . The uncontrolled action of the primary medicine is sometimes compared with the effects of poison ( mers ), and, indeed, “memele[unknown]sa” is also used as a gloss for “antidote”."
t0229 cite0009 MP05 "A client’s notion of a therapy’s completeness is based on the therapist’s demonstrated ability to process and administer (but not necessarily gather) his medicaments. It is mainly on the basis of the observable completeness of a therapy that the herbalist-owner is given a practitioner title by his potential clients. That is not to say that completeness is, of itself, a [Page 57] sufficient condition fro grading herbalists by title. Rather, it is the observed coincidence, within real therapies, of completeness together with a strong primary medicine and an effective memele[unknown]sa that in relevant. This relationship will be made clear in the following paragraphs, which describe each named category of Amhara herbalist...."
t0229 cite0009 MP05 "An herbalist’s professional title incorporates both the name of the ailment which he treats and the practitioner category (according to completeness of therapy) into which he fits (e.g., yianfula [disease name] medhaniyt awakiy [herbalist category]). The least of these categories is “medhaniyt seci” . The medical activities of this practitioner are limited to gathering cateria medica and presenting them to his client, together with information regarding the proper processing and administration of these ingredients. The processing required is invariably simple, involves no magical elements, often is vague about relative proportions, non-commital regarding dosages and may even lack details concerning the requisite number of repetitions. Generally, the therapist is not present during the administration of the medicaments. Before presenting the medicinals to his client, the horbalist alters the ingredients, by crumbling leaves or denuding sprigs, so that the client will be unable to [Page 58] recognize them should he come across these botanicals in the wild."
t0229 cite0009 MP05 "Another practitioner, the medhaniyt ateci, presents his client with fully processed medicaments generally in the form of infusion, and provides information only regarding their administration. Medhaniyt ateci therapies are considered, as a class, more powerful that therapies practiced by the medhaniyt seci, by virtue of professional processing (particularly in the measurement of ingredients)...."
t0229 cite0009 MP05 "A third category of herbalist, the medhaniyt awakiy (“medicine expert”) provides the most complete therapy, performing all relevant pharmacological activities himself. This class of therapies is associated with strong medicines, serious ailments, and the performance of a professional diagnosis. Diagnosis, in the sense of evaluating symptoms prior to the administration of therapy, takes place in the sickman’s homestead, among kinfolk and neighbors, and before a therapist is consulted. The “completeness” of the latter’s therapy determines whether there will be any further diagnosis. If he practices a complete therapy, the herbalist will perform a diagnosis after the primary medicine has been administered and its effect felt. Here, the therapist carefully examines the sickman’s evacuae (feces and vomit), in order to assess the medicine’s relevance [Page 59] to the sickman’s ailment and, if appropriate, its effectiveness in expelling the pathogenic substance. In the evacuae the therapist looks for evidence of the pathogenic substance itself (now rendered into amorphous pieces), worms ( tils ) which the pathogen may have produces, and the wastes of internal organs ravaged by the pathogen. In this diagnosis, the therapist applies criteria of color (white, green, black, and blood-red) and consistency (liquid, viscous, solid). The expected combinations and the putative significance of each are known only to the therapist, and expected combinations have no obvious symbolic relevance beyond the specific therapeutic context...."
t0229 cite0009 MP05 "Sometimes the herbalist cites in addition the fees which he recives, as recognition of these “expert” abilities, and even of his client’s satisfaction with the therapy. In practice, a nominal fee is almost always paid, whatever the therapy’s success. The medhaniyt seci receives a token fee of perhaps E$.50 to E$1., and probably no more than three to five times that amount for a successful cure."
t0230 cite0009 MP05 "It is clear from the preceeding chapter that 1) herbalists are distinguished from other secular healers by a distinctive classificatory system, and 2) this distinction can be functionally related to certain features of the healers’ respective practices. Foremost among these features is the relative uniformity of healing powers of practitioners. While there is substantial uniformity within each named category of chirurgeon, 9 the herbalists working within any single disease-name specialty are arrayed along a wide range of powers and therapeutic [Page 83] effectiveness. The uniformity of the chirurgeons’ healing powers can be traced to the fact that their operations are relatively simple and easily learned. A man begins his apprenticeship while still a youth, under the tutledge of a senior kinsman. Generally, he does not assume professional status until his mentor has died or retired, or until he has moved beyond the natal parish and out of the range of possible competition with his healer-kinsman. In either event, the apprenticeship is lengthy enough to ensure technical mastery, within the limits set by the healer’s natural abilities. The tagañ (bonesetter) is an exception, since his operations are by no means simple, and his natural skills more significantly affect his success as a therapist. Thus, there are more considerable differences in healing powers among tagañs than among other chirurgeons."
t0230 cite0009 MP05 "9 For convenience, “chirurgeon” is used here to describe all secular practitioners who are not herbalists."
t0231 cite0009 MP05 "The logically maximal chain . Using these grades, a client can construct “chains” of real herbalists, ranging from least to most powerful, in the relevant disease-name specialty. The following formula contains all logically possible herbalist chains. In this description, the symbol “-[unknown]” is used to indicate that “therapeutic failure by the antecedent practitioner is followed by consultation with the following practitioner”...."
t0231 cite0009 MP05 "Real chains avoid consultations with more than one practitioner of the same or adjacent grades. This simplification results from a tendency of clients to generalize from an experience with a specific herbalist to all herbalists of that grade and disease-name specialty. The therapeutic failure of a weak therapy, one provided by a medhaniyt seci or medhaniyt ateci , indicates to the client that nothing short of a strong therapy will be effective in this episode. The client’s freedom to generalize in this fashion is encouraged by several considerations. First, it is convenient for a client to treat all herbalists of the same grade as more or less pharmacological equals ( vide supra ). Second, in the [Page 87] case of serious and acute ailments, the exigencies of time force the client to seek rapid and efficient diagnosis as the prerequisite of an effective cure. To confine therapy to a single grade of herbalist is to minimize chances for an accurate diagnosis, since a second or third therapeutic failure at the same herbalist grade is diagnostically no more informative than the first failure. Even in the case of chronic ailments, it is unusual for a client to engage more than a single herbalist of the same grade. Instead, the client follows initial failure with therapeutic inactivity, which either remains permanent for the ailment in question, or is eventually ended by consulting a higher grade herbalist."
t0231 cite0009 MP05 "The relationship between practitioner, etiology, and syndrome is not always so clear-cut, however. Occaisionally, a client consults no herbalist at all, even though the syndrome at hand appears appropriate to an herbalist specialty. The client, instead chooses a debtera (or, less often a balazar ) as the initial healer in the episode. Like herbalists debtera s are sorted into a graded series according to differences in healing power. In the abstract, the client arranges the two types of practitioners into parallel and mutually distinct series, according to the sources of their respective healing powers. While the herbalist’s powers derive from prosaically transmitted pharmacological information, [Page 88] the debtera ’s powers are derived from his intimacy with spirit beings, the ganels...."
t0231 cite0009 MP05 "Real herbalist chains are, then constructed by clients on an ad hoc basis. In constructing his herbalist chain, the client is dependent upon, first, the actual distribution of relevant practitioners within his environs, and, second, persons who can communicate this information to him. A client knows the herbal specialties of most residents of his own hamlet, and of the more prominent healers of the parish in which his hamlet is located. Beyond the parish, however, he knows the names of few secular practitioners, and these few are healers with whom he has stood previously as a client. To build his chain, he must often rely on information [Page 90] provided by kinsmen, neighbors, and lower grade herbalists who are familiar with the identity of professional colleagues in their own disease-name specialties. A client sometimes has difficulty finding local herbalists with which to staff a desired herbalist chain. The (“weak”) debtera is often a “convenient” choice to fill this deficiency. He is a member of a class of practitioners who are famous for practicing therapies for a wide variety of ailments. Moreover, the debtera is conspicuous. In ecclesiastical performances, divination, and providing prophylactic amulets, he is observed and patronized by many residents of the district in which he lives. Thus, although potential clients may not know his therapeutic repertoire in detail, he is considered a potentially relevant practitioner about whom clients are always likely to make active inquiries."
t0232 cite0009 MP05 "Kinship ties are an important means by which the peasant acquires and communicates information necessary for constructing herbalist chains. Since almost every herbalist therapy of the rural parish enjoys its own “pedigree”, or trans-generational reputation, the peasant herbalist is provided with means for 1) publicly validating his therapeutic claims, and 2) communicating the existence of the therapy to his potential clients. Potential clients frequently associate the ownership of a famous herbalist therapy with the members of a specific ambilineage, often identifiable by name. Both the ambilineage (whose identity is linked to its fields) and its medical reputation (which is tied to the ambilineage) are attached to a particular location. Since residence is most often viripatrilocal, the transmission of such therapeutic reputations is characterized by an agnatic bias. The male therapist moving to town, like [Page 134] the female moving away to her husband’s parish, is generally cut off from this reputation. Thus, the herbalist in the town must most often establish this professional existence and reputation de novo . There is no way in which he can stimulate clients to come his way other than by empirical proofs. If his therapy is directed against an ailment for which even expert herbalist therapy promises success in only a fraction of cases, or an ailment which is epidemiologically infrequent, his difficulties are so much the greater. Thus, in spite of Gondar’s relatively great population, the town contains only a handful of herbalists of provincial-wide fame. These same considerations dampen the herbalist’s readiness to acquire new disease-name specialties. In addition to the difficulties already noted in Chapter 2, such a therapist would likewise be forced to establish his new professional presence de novo , even though he enjoyed an already established reputation against another ailment."
t0232 cite0009 MP05 "The contrast between the place of herbalist therapies in town and country has been most notably effected by the relative accessibility of non-herbalist therapies in the town. This is a result of the concentration of non-herbalist practitioners in towns, and of the relative affluence enabling townsmen to purchase more expensive therapies."
t0232 cite0009 MP05 "A government hospital, located on the edge of Gondar provides the most important non-traditional therapies. Most townsfolk regard hospital therapy with considerable apprehension, because of its strangeness and of numerous apochryphal tales describing its therapies. Nevertheless, the Amhara does not dispute the power of Western medicine, at least regarding some ailments. This respect is largely explained by the demonstrated successes of Western medicine, and the fact that, operationally, it coincides with certain traditional notions of what powerful therapies should be like. In particular, the violent introjective mode associated with the most commonly experienced of hospital therapies, merify (injection), is regarded as consistent with notions of strong therapies. Moreover, the practitioner of Western medicine, like powerful traditional healers, is characterized by a general mastery over an extensive disease domain, through abstruse sources of power. Western therapy is not in general well integrated into traditional medical beliefs, but tends to be considered mainly from a pragnatic perspective. Thus, hospital therapy is a likely choice for ailments against which it has repeatedly demonstrated successful cures and against which traditional healers are predictably less successful. Conspicuous here are abscesses, ulcerations, and other superficial but potentially serious infections, [Page 136] known as kusil and ibac . In addition, Western therapy is sought for ailments which are serious and chronic, but for which traditional cures offer a poor prognosis or only palliatives. For these ailments (in particular, leprosy, kuntina ; chronic coughing, yisaal ba[unknown]siyta , including tuberculosis, yilib ba[unknown]siyta ; and a variety of stomach ailments, yihod himem and migaña ), Western medicine is believed to offer prognosis equal to that of powerful traditional non-secular therapies, but not necessarily superior to them."
t0233 cite0009 MP05 "The debtera ’s public explains his medical superiority over secular practitioners in terms of the technical differences which they perceive [Page 188] between the works performed by the two categories of healers. 31 Laymen conceive the debtera ’s healing powers as the product of his knowledge of asmat , possession of awdunigist , and intimacy with ganel familiars. Although the layman recognizes that his own knowledge of these matters is inexact, he assumes that the debtera ’s use of asmat , awdunigist , and familiars can be synthesized into an integral body of learning, skills, and practices. Two types of syntheses are believed possible. The first of these characterizes the “weak” ( tini[unknown]s ) debtera , already discussed in chapter three. This debtera lacks demon familiars, but he can perform awdunigist calculations and he possesses sufficient asmat to provide prophylactic amulets and a number of therapies. However, his prophylaxes are easily breached by powerful sorcerers or determined ganel s, and his therapeutic powers do not exceed those of secular herbalists. The second synthesis characterizes the awakiy debtera . Here, the debtera ’s professional title signals the possession of ganel familiars. [Page 189] The weak debtera ’s asmat are finite, prosaically acquired, and mainly limited to prophylactic applications; the awagly debtera , through his daemons has unlimited asmat resources. These asmat are equally effective in meeting prophylactic, therapeutic, and offensive ends, and are well beyond the abilities of any secular persons. Thanks to his ganel -tutors, the awakiy debtera divines with precision and reliability much greater than those of his lesser colleagues. In addition to using ganel -taught asm[unknown]at , the awakiy debtera can employ his daemons directly, particularly in offensive contexts."
t0233 cite0009 MP05 "31 The layman’s belief in the medical superiority of the awakiy debtera is asserted verbally, in the context of herbalist chains, and in the impressive fees paid to the debtera (for therapy, ten times and more the amount paid to a secular healer; for prophylaxes, fees between E$50. and E$300. are not uncommon)."
t0234 cite0009 MP05 "The attitude of the secular healer towards his therapy is essentially possessive. From his perspective, the therapy is an immutable composition; its elements of asmat are individually unintelligible, and are sorted into combinations by rote. The layman’s medical powers are specific, for they are limited to exclusively therapeutic applications; moreover, they are fixed, since they are relevant to a small number of named and etiologically unrelated ailments. In contrast, the debtera ’s attitude towards his repertoire of medical knowledge is recognized as active and manipulative. Through his daemons, he has access to unlimited asmat ; what is more, he knows the lexicon of this magic and understands the syntax of therapeutic combinations. Thus, he is able to produce a great variety of therapeutic statements, each tailored to the specific vulnerabilities and needs of his client. The debtera is believed to own powers of very general [Page 193] application. In a medical context, he is adept in all but the chirurgeon’s domain, and his works are perceived as strong. In addition to therapy, he is an expert diagonostician, and giver of prophylaxis. Finally, the debtera ’s medical powers are perceived as only an aspect of the more general powers he possesses, and which he displays in various non-medical works affecting property, interpersonal relations, and, importantly, the sending of illness."
t0235 cite0009 MP05 "The secular healer (particularly the medhaniyt awakiy ) is reluctant to part with professional knowledge, even when a reasonable price is offered. Unlike the abinet capital of debtera s, medical capital dissipates as it is “spent”. ... [contrasts this system to the collaborative nature of debtera knowledge sharing] ... the professional reputation of the lay healer is tied to a specific ailment, just as he himself is tied to a specific locality, as the sedentary cultivator of ambilineage fields. Since a layman’s medical reputation is fixed in space, potential purchasers of his medical knowledge are drawn from among his potential clients. Thus, by sharing his medical knowledge with another secular healer, the lay practitioner establishes a potential rival and dilutes the economic and social advantages of his practice."
t0236 cite0009 MP05 "While out playing, ten year old Tesfahun and two companions were bitten by a dog. After they returned to their ward, Tesfahun told his mother, Berey, what had happened; and the woman took him to a nearby stream. She directed him to wade into it, so that he would not develop the fear of water that is characteristic of the later stages of rabies ( yimatfow wuw[unknown]sa ba[unknown]siyta ), when the introjected dog-like spirit agent begins to make its hydrophobic presence felt. In her village there lived a yimatfow wuw[unknown]sa ba[unknown]siyta medhaniyt seci . From this herbalist, Berey received a root with the directions that, once it had been ground and mixed with water, it must be immediately consumed or would loose its potency. On the next day, before she had an opportunity to prepare the infusion, Berey fell into a conversation with a neighbor regarding the previous day’s happenings. The neighbor, a Muslim, remarked that a fukura (here, a Muslim healer analogous to a “weak” debtera ) living in another ward was famous for his ability to treat rabies. Tesfahun was taken to the fukura , who commanded him to undress and gaze into the practitioner’s mirror. While the boy stared at it, the fukura , who was a blind man, did likewise. [Page 241] After a minute, the practitioner declared that Tesfahun had not contracted the ailment. The fukura was was paid E$1., and Tesfahun was given no therapy. His companions were later taken to this practitioner, who after diagnosis indicated that both had contracted rabies, and required therapy. None of the participants attempted to obtain an explanation for this epidemiological pattern. This consisted of herbals mixed with the milk of a cow nursing a calf of its own color. The infusion was a violent purgative, and a memele[unknown]sa permitted its safe application until blood had appeared in the evacuae. This was taken as a sign that the disease substance had been destroyed and was being eliminated. Although all of this had taken place within one week of the dog’s attack, the principals were aware that the ailment can be treated successfully within four weeks of an attack. After that time, no therapy, however powerful it may be, can succeed. The fukura sold his therapy at the of E$10. for each boy. Although the fee was paid on receipt of therapy, this was not necessary; the payment could have been made to a third party (a gwadeña of the client), who would then transmit the money to the therapist once the therapy had proven itself effective."
t0237 cite0010 FK07 "When Ndawula [an old king] grew old, he caught an eye disease which baffled all the doctors. At long last, there came a man who told the king that he was a specialist in eye diseases. “But once I give you my medicine”, he claimed, “you must hide in the forest so that people may not see you. If they see you, your eyes will not get cured. If, however, someone meets you, you must forbid him to let anyone else know. Should he fail to keep your whereabouts secret, he must be brought before you tied on a rope, and as soon as you see him, he should be killed at once. If you fulfil all these conditions, your eyes will get completely cured.” After Ndawula had conferred with his mother, his maternal uncle and his prime minister, he set off with the doctor. They went and hid in Nawanku forest which was on Mengo hill. He was treated only for a few days and the disease got cured. As soon as he had recovered his sight, he began to walk along the borders of the forest and the banana gardens. But one day, he met a man called Siroganga, who was going to hunt. The king asked him not to report him, and Siroganga assured him that he would not."

t0239 cite0142 FL12 "The Masai have their treatment for numerous diseases. Members of the Il Darsoero clan appear to be the most skilled in medicine. They have often shown me herbs which they use, but I have for the most part forgotten the Masai names for them, and lack of botanical knowledge prevents me from giving their scientifie names. Such Masai as understand the use of herbs have never shown any reluctance to tell me about it."
t0240 cite0015 FL12 "In effect the normal protection of all pregnant beings is reversed in an attempt to reverse widespread unpregnancy. There is a shift in emphasis in this festival from the women's ritual of rebellion against the elders to a ritual reversal shared by both sexes and the notion of purification in a matter that poses a threat to the whole community. It would only be contemplated when forces destroying reproductivity are already felt to be rampant. These have to be met with a sorcerous act of similar magnitude, after close consultation with the Prophet as an expert in sorcery. It is comparable with the heinous act of installing the ritual leader at eunoto from which others that have a close sympathy with the victim stand to benefit."
t0241 cite0143 MO04 "All savage races have their medicine men, and the Somali is no exception. Among the members of most of the tribes will be recognized surgical experts whose methods, although somewhat rough and ready, are often most ingenious."
t0241 cite0143 MO04 "It is well-nigh impossible to witness a Somali surgeon operating, so one can only judge by the results, which, after all is said and done, are the workman’s best test, and these are very frequently highly creditable, if not excellent."
t0241 cite0143 MO04 "Both the surgical and medical treatment of any case is almost invariably accompanied by the slaughter of a fat sheep or camel, the flesh of the latter animal, in particular, being credited with the most beneficial effects on patients, especially those recovering from some prolonged illness. The effect of a camel feast in Somaliland might favourably compare with the results derived from a visit to Lourdes, such great faith have the Somalis in the strengthening and healing properties of the flesh of this odorous beast!"
t0241 cite0143 MO04 "Faith, indeed, has to play as great a part in the Somali country as elsewhere in more civilized countries."
t0241 cite0143 MO04 "They have far greater faith in their own simple remedies than in any of the drugs of civilization, with the possible exception of sulphur and the liniment of iodine."
t0241 cite0143 MO04 "The marvellous recuperative powers of the Somali, together with the beneficial effects of a clear dry atmosphere and the sterilizing effect of the sun, have [Page 157] to answer for the rapid healing of wounds, provided they are kept well cleaned; in no country with which I am acquainted is there less need of antiseptics."
t0242 cite0019 MO04 "The expert himself supplies the patient with those plants or parts of plants that are needed in the treatment. If they require any form of preparation or extraction he will see to that too. The administration of the cure is also supervised by the herbalist. If repeated administration is necessary, the herbalist will usually stay overnight at the patient’s home or return there with the medicine when it is time. If he asks a direct question, the patient will usually be told the name of the plant being administered. However, experts will not volunteer such information and they frequently attempt to conceal the exact method of preparation."
t0243 cite0019 MO04 "It may well be that the varying efficacy ascribed to these different forms of medication is related to their availability. Whereas kiniin is usually available from any countryside shop, kabsuls tend to be obtainable only from pharmacies. Finally, erbad is almost exclusively administered by specialists. Though I have never heard it explicitly said, it would appear that those medicines that are most difficult to obtain are considered to be the most powerful."
t0243 cite0019 MO04 "There exists concerning daawo therapy both a lay knowledge and expert controlled skills. The experts are pharmacists or people with some form of government health training, such as community health workers. There are many free-lance “doctors” with a background in the colonial health service or without any form of education. In district centers there are dispensaries and in several regional centers there are clinics with access to foreign doctors."
t0243 cite0019 MO04 "These different types of experts are not equally appreciated, although the term dakhtar is often used for anybody associated with daawo . The foremost treatment is held to be that offered by foreigners. An example is that when a TB clinic, staffed by a Finnish medical team, was to be opened in the town Baydhabo, the rumour of this quickly spread in the countryside. Long before the clinic had opened, every morning outside its gates there was a crowd of patients claiming to suffer from a variety of ailments. [Page 115] In the same way foreign veterinarians may be consulted for purely human diseases. I myself have also been consulted for the most varied symptoms. My medicines appeared to be particularly attractive although they had often been purchased from local pharmacies."
t0244 cite0019 MO04 "Concerning the treatments based on tablets, capsules and injections, daawo, it was established that this type of medicine is often seen as connected to foreigners in the sense of non-Muslims and non-Somalis. I also showed that that there is a tendency to favour experts who are foreigners themselves or who are believed to have received their knowledge from foreigners. The distinction between the knowledge of infidels and the knowledge of Muslims is also given a cosmological correspondence in the “this world/next world” doctrine. Medicine in itself is seen as particularly powerful if it has come from abroad and, in pharmacies, the country of origin may be of considerable importance in the choice between different medicines. It was also said to be an advantage if the medicine is accompanied by instructions in some foreign language. Foreigners as such, however, are not seen as intrinsically good; rather they belong to a category of people in which one can also expect to find enemies."
t0245 cite0144 MO04 "Girls are infibulated about the age of puberty—between eleven and thirteen years of age—but sometimes earlier, the vulva being scarified and then drawn together and held until its sides have knit together but for a small orifice. This is done usually by a woman who belongs to a specialist occupational group of low status. A portion of the clitoris is also excised to make the girl clean ( [unknown]halaal ) in a Muslim sense. The operation is usually performed individually and without much ceremonial. The object is to prepare a girl for marriage and to safeguard her virginity until that time. The excision of part of the clitoris may be made separately at a more tender age. See de Villeneuve 1937."
t0246 cite0145 MO04 "Sesame oil is also sometimes used as a medicine. This is obviously not a very impressive list, but [Page 162] these are probably only the plants known to everyone, while, as has been noted, the greater part of the vegetal pharmacopoeia is known only to the experts."
t0247 cite0145 MO04 "The natives believe that the best way to deal with snakebites or scorpion stings is to entrust themselves to those experts who are privileged by Allah to nourish a serpent in their own entrails. The saliva of these privileged beings, mixed with butter and then applied to the previously opened wounds, is [Page 168] thought to render the poison harmless, but the natives also recommend ueirag ( Andropogon caesius Vatke)"
t0248 cite0146 MT09 "Before the former sheikh of that tribal segment died (he was Muftah’s uncle), one member of the group got into an argument with the police officer in charge of the police station in the district. The tribesman insulted the police officer who insisted on arresting him. Rumors also had it that the police officer was using his authority to reduce the share of the tribal segment in the government aid which was badly needed during that particular year. Sheikh Muftah, whose father is the Aquila of [Page 100] bait Mughaieb of the Sanagrah tribe, went to the officer and apologized to him on behalf of the whole group and invited him to a lavish dinner party. The charges against the tribesman were soon dropped, and it was concluded that it was because of the way Muftah had handled the situation. Since that incident, Muftah has been known as an expert in handling the government officials. One year later, the sheikh of the tribal segment died, and a meeting was held during which the important members of the Sanagrah tribal segment in the district decided to nominate Muftah for the position of the sheikh, vacant by the death of his uncle. Muftah, who was attending the meeting, was asked to accept the nomination, and he agreed. “...I accepted the nomination reluctantly.” Muftah later told me, “I did not really want to become the sheikh. The position does not bring any personal benefit, and it involves a lot of responsibility. The sheikh has to act as an attorney for his tribe, represent it to the government and competes with other sheikhs to bring his people things that the other sheikhs cannot get for theirs, like more membership in the cooperative units or in the socialist union. And what does he get in return? Nothing...not even the gratitude of his people. To them, he is a servant of the tribe, and his duty is to look after its interest. If he doesn’t, then everybody is quick to criticize him. I had to accept the nomination because I felt it was my duty to do so and not to embarrass the awaqil and the important people of the tribe who put their confidence in me. As far as the government, all I get is six pounds a month.”"
t0249 cite0147 MW11 "Had his daughter failed to become pregnant, he would have had considerable extra expenses in the form of trips to magical specialists or saints' shrines in the hope of increasing his daughter's fertility, plus the increasing worry, as time passed, that she would be divorced, stigmatized as barren, and returned to him."
t0250 cite0148 FQ05 "A girl may have little intellectual understanding of what is being done at the time of her chisungu [intitiation ritual], although she may be in a highly emotional state in which she is likely to be suggestible to the general emphasis laid on the importance of marriage and childbirth. Next year however she will act as a young helper of the nacimbusa and so her knowledge will grow. As one old nacimbusa put it ‘If she has seen two ceremonies, or three, a girl will come to me and say “Tell me about the crocodile”. She remembers and then she comes and asks me again “Tell me some more about the crocodile” and I tell her more. But other girls have no ears. They do not ask anything. They just say “Let it be, those are things of the chisungu” ’. In other words, clever girls begin to memorize and get more and more knowledge of the deeper associations of the symbols and these girls probably become specialist banacimbusa [teachers] as they grow older. The others, no doubt, give up when they find they cannot master the intricacies of the ceremonial."
t0251 cite0149 FQ09 "Leeches and diviners are among the most common important specialists of Lozi society. Many of them are Old Mbunda and Wiko. The longer I lived among the Lozi the more I felt that almost everyone was skilled in treating some disease. Certain of them are well known over wide areas."
t0251 cite0149 FQ09 "Should a Lozi suffer a misfortune, he is likely to resort to a diviner to detect the cause. Some of these causes I have already mentioned: royal spirits, sorcerers, the ancestors. But many diseases are almost personified by the Lozi and are commonly divined: liyala, maimbwe, mabamba, sisongo, muba , and others. Some of these diseases are more clearly associated with demons; thus muba is related to mwendandjangula and mwenda-lutaka , demons of the bush and the Plain respectively, which have half of human bodies and are fiery red. They are of both sexes. Should one of these spirits desire a man or woman, it will try to kidnap him or her, and can at least strike with severe illness. In all these diseases the treatment aims to produce, by smoking, drumming, and singing, hysteric symptoms: violent jerkings of the body in a state of seeming trance. When a patient is being treated, kin and neighbours come to attend. The drumming wakens the disease in all of them who have been ill of it before and they too will join in the violent dance of the sufferer. The disease links together all sufferers, and anyone who recovers from a severe attack has to become a leech treating it."
t0252 cite0150 FQ09 "His son Lukama was not normal mentally, and Ngalama sent him to Mange, the son of Nolea, who had come to power among the Magwangwa. Lukama was to be cured there by a great sorcerer who was an expert on this illness. Lukama, however, was inadvertently killed while playing with some other boys. The boys had thrown a cover over him, under which he suffocated."
t0253 cite0022 FQ09 "I do not have information from analysis of the active principles and properties present in the treatments prescribed for specific symptoms although I have lists of such prescriptions for Bulozi and there are published lists for two neighbouring areas sharing basically the same botanical resources as Bulozi. Simply to look at the lists and prescriptions is to gain two impressions. Firstly, they would not have been recoverably in this form if much of it had not worked; secondly, with no notion of dosage, the risk of failure even if the active principle was right was thereby increased. But here, as in those cases for which the prescription was wrong, there was a sequential series of blocks to falsifiability: if the specific treatment failed, this would be a sign that the affliction was not simple and it therefore required specialist treatment. If the healer's specifics failed, this was a sign of evil interference which had to be identified by divination, and in this way a structural block could be invoked, even if the patient died. Thus a difficult case would move along one axis of the table from individual to communal and the other from symptomatic to non-symptomatic treatment, hence diagonally. The line could be extended off the table since for affliction beyond the norm, such as the early 1890s smallpox epidemic, recourse could only be through appeal to the unseen powers and there divinatory practice merged with the other functions of the royal graves."
t0254 cite0023 FQ09 "It is to be emphasized that the mere possession of a needle as a protective charm does not enable the wearer to project siposo . Projection is a highly skilled and dangerous affair for the witchdoctor or sorcerer who employs it; should the attack be parried, the missile returns to harm the sender. He must, therefore, wear needle charms, [Page 41] or perhaps ngoba beads, as a defence in case of failure. The ngoba , which are an assortment of actual Venetian and other beads and carved pieces of root, are usually worn as a bracelet (Fig. 6(a), (b) and (c)) and are only to be found in the possession of a siposo expert. Their possession is proof positive of deep knowledge of, and great skill in siposo matters. The owner may be either a sorcerer or witchdoctor."
t0255 cite0023 FQ09 "This wide separation of the two professions [witchdoctor and herbal specialist] has no counterpart in a central African environment. They are closely allied and, in many situations, no sharp distinction can be drawn between them. Both kinds of doctor are called ng'aka, a strong indication of the proximity of their relationship in African eyes. This is not to say that the African does not recognize the differences between them. Any reasonably intelligent villager can explain that while the one deals directly with a malady using herbal and other medicines, the other, where witchcraft is diagnosed, cures the patient by parrying, by defeating and, if necessary, by killing the witch or sorcerer. The leech may give the patient a charm to wear or slip a needle under his skin, as a defence against magical attacks, but he is not thereby considered a witchdoctor. Because he recognizes that a particular illness is caused by a member of the spirit world, it does not mean that he considers that spirit a witch or a sorcerer. Perhaps one may obtain the best perspective if one considers the witchdoctor as a kind of specialist dealing only with those troubles, not necessarily medical, caused by witches or by sorcerers. Just as the specialist is a superior [Page 49] doctor, so the doctor of witchcraft, ng'aka ya buloi , is a superior ng'aka . He is indeed colloquially known as a ‘big’ doctor and is considered to be much more skilled and experienced than is his herbal counterpart...."
t0255 cite0023 FQ09 "The ng'aka , therefore, is employed where a malady or misfortune is caused by something mysterious and inexplicable to ordinary people. He is consulted only on the advice of a diviner though, as is explained later, he may himself be the diviner. Each lay specialist usually knows but a few remedies or charms. The ng'aka , however, unless he is a ‘small’ doctor able to treat only a limited number of ailments, as often are doctors of muba or of sisongo , is considered able to cure all those maladies that are treated by the lay specialist. His fees are, of course, much higher, and it is understandable that, wherever possible, a man avails himself in the first instance of the services of the layman."
t0256 cite0023 FQ09 "The witchdoctor, as befits a man who is a specialist, often rises from the ranks of the herbal doctors. Frequently, however, a layman may feel constrained to join this specialized branch of doctoring and so by-passes, and perhaps completely ignores his less spectacular, more humble colleagues, though when he falls ill of an ordinary complaint he has to place himself in their hands. One such case involved a herbal doctor who cured a witchdoctor of a kaliloze bullet wound in the leg. The gun used was of the modern variety."
t0256 cite0023 FQ09 "The tendency to specialize, found among European scientists and medical men, has its counterpart among the Bantu. Just as the witchdoctor is a specialist among doctors, so is the sikuyeti doctor a specialist among witchdoctors, The difference would appear to be that whereas the ordinary witchdoctor is content, where possible, to remove the evil influence from his patient and to foil or expose the muloi , the sikuyeti doctor is much more ruthless; his aim is the destruction of the offending muloi . Some baloi are too powerful for the ordinary witchdoctor to tackle; the sikuyeti doctor, however, is able to trap and kill even the cleverest. The kaliloze doctor, it would appear is, for the lunda-luvale , what the sikuyeti doctor is for the luyana."
t0257 cite0023 FQ09 "It might be argued from the use of the term, ng'aka wa pula , that the raindoctor is but a specialist ng'aka and should be included in Chapter III. Informants agree, however, that raindoctoring is a distinctly separate practice and should be described accordingly in a chapter of its own. The confusion as to whether or not a sitondo is an ng'aka arises from the fact that most, if not all sitondo are able to treat injuries caused by lightning. By so doing they become herbal doctors and, therefore, ng'aka proper. Should they restrict their activities to rain and lightning direction, they are merely sitondo."
t0258 cite0151 FE12 "Chastising a girl for promiscuity is the duty of the father, for while a daughter spends more time with her mother than her father, any disgrace caused by a daughter must be born equally by the father. Punishment for promiscuity is beating, or turning the girl out of the house naked (cf. Cruickshank, v. II, p. 209). Deterrants to prevent the continuance of indiscretions are forcing the girl to douche with a solution of pepper and ginger, or making her drink a mixture supplied by a priest or medical practitioner, and telling her a god (obosom) will punish her if she persists in misbehaving."
t0259 cite0025 FE12 "Onset about six months ago when he fainted while standing in a drill-parade during a teacher-training course. He became rapidly worse, was delirious, violent and attacked people with a cutlass. He was admitted to a Kumasi hospital, where a course of injections was started, but the relatives removed him against medical advice, believing the illness supernaturally caused. He went then to his uncle's “village” where he was treated by native practitioners. He became worse: the mother describes epileptiform fits. The uncle then decided that the illness was caused by the mother's witchcraft and brought him a great distance to the village where I found him, telling the medicine-man that if the mother came near the patient, he (the uncle) would wash his hands of the whole matter. The patient did not improve and became unable to talk."
t0260 cite0152 FE12 "The adwumfo, in the present context goldsmiths ( adwini is any skilled work in gold, silver, or leather), were in ancient time an honoured class. All goldsmiths formed a sort of brotherhood, and any goldsmith had the privilege of calling a fellow-goldsmith's wife ‘my wife’, 1 and they were privileged to wear gold ornaments, a form of personal adornment otherwise rigorously restricted to kings, their wives, and the greater chiefs. In the Bekwai administrative division of Ashanti all the goldsmiths trace their origin to one Fusu Kwebi, the first of their trade. The bellows and a few of the weights and tools of this now almost divine ancestor are still preserved, and along with his obosom (god), Ta Yao, have become the goldsmith's particular god (see Fig. 111). His cult has even extended beyond the goldsmiths' guild, and his god (one of Tano's many ‘sons’) is now consulted by others who are not in the trade. The ancient bellows, now only a crumbling piece of wood with the skin long since rotted away, are resorted to by wives who are accused of unfaithfulness who wish to attest their innocence, by drinking wine that has been allowed to flow over this fragment."
t0261 cite0153 FE12 "Childlessness is attributed to two main causes. The first is premarital laxity on the woman's part; the second is an incompatibility of the different types of ‘blood’ (semen) of the man and the vaginal secretion. ‘Many native doctors claim to have medicines, mostly of a magical kind’, for correcting the latter and ‘inducing pregnancy and successful practitioners soon become very wealthy’."
t0262 cite0154 FE12 "In Asante it is women who are the knowledgeable genealogists, doubtless because it is through them that descent is reckoned. In 1965 I was able to talk with the elderly Nana Yaa Kyaa of Akorase, a great-great-granddaughter of Akyaawa. True to form, she was able to narrate the intricate ramifications of her family history."
t0263 cite0155 FA16 "In addition to the priests and religious functionaries of the various cults, there are seers or visionaries (KUMOGU) and diviners. Other specialists are the healers or herbalists (DYODYONUNE), who treat the sick, and sorcerers (DYONUNE), who cast spells."
t0264 cite0029 FA16 "The teaching of the sigi so [sacred and secret language, used for ritual]. The elders teach it to the young postulants for the Society of the Masks on the occasion of a dama or a Sigi. There are, moreover, specialists for this teaching, to whom it is necessary to pay “thirty-three thousand and three cowries” (an expression meaning a very substantial sum) in order to become their pupil. Few Dogon seem to have a profound knowledge of the sigi so."
t0264 cite0029 FA16 "The teaching is preceded by special rites: master and pupil must drink from the same calabash a mixture of beer, oil of sesame, and pediñe (previously crushed). A little of this mixture is then poured into the auditory canal of the pupil, in order that he may have “good ears.”"
t0264 cite0029 FA16 "The teaching properly speaking starts with very simple phrases including the enumeration of different degrees of kinship and some salutations. The vocabulary is learned in a precise order: food, drink, parts of the body (starting with the head), facts relating to the Imina na, the rhombos, etc."
t0265 cite0156 FA16 "There is little known about Laya's childhood. After 1949 he was secretary to Ogobara who then became “canton chief” and was his inseparable attendant, his mouthpiece, his tool, and admirer — a petit frère who regarded it as his life's work to help his grand frère carry on his administrative duties. During their joint travels on official business, Laya was said to have been particularly attentive toward the sick and injured. Through his connection with Dogon priests and marabouts who were skilled in the art of healing, he was given medicines, and he even brought about miraculous cures. When, as a result of a different political structure, Ogobara was no longer “canton chief” (1958), the village secretary was obliged to look for other occupations. He went to Bandiagara and in the hospital there began a course in male nursing. He lives there in the family house and provides for his two wives and his children who have stayed with Ogobara's family in Sanga."

t0267 cite0158 MS12 "To illustrate extremes, a farmer, no. 22 of B community, and a seller of spices, no. 84 of G, have been chosen. Both are simple budgets, self-explanatory and severely limited to the essentials for Hausa rural living standards. The contrast between them centres on farming. No. 84, a stranger to G, had no farms in 1949 and his gross income is 92 per cent. cash, whereas no. 22, a native of B, farms vigorously but has a low cash income. Of 22’s earnings as a herbal specialist in curing syphilis, nothing unfortunately is known."
t0268 cite0159 MS12 "Although they [the community] were poor, Gauranga came to prize them, and on Friday he would slaughter as many as ten cows and then distribute the meat as alms to the Hausa. One reason for his generosity was his reliance upon their leaders for various ritual practices. Their mallamai were expert in hisabi and larabi, numerology and soothsaying, and he regularly consulted at least four men among the strangers. 63 The Dassinawa had also established four schools for their own children, but the local inhabitants began to attend them once the teachers learned sufficient Arabic or Barma. In addition to this elementary education, there were mallamai capable of [Page 38] teaching such disciplines as hadisi, shari’a, and tauhidi —tradition, law, and theology."
t0269 cite0159 MS12 "Beyond these traditional interpretations of malanta lie related activities and specializations. One of the most prevalent in Chad is that of the counselor (or fortune teller, charm maker, or wonder-worker), in which various mallamai employ particular aspects of their learning in explaining or influencing the supernatural. Some are experts in the interpretation of dreams, while others cast horoscopes, advise on journeys, or make charms to ensure success. The distinction between the mallam and his non-Islamic counterpart, the herbalist, becomes obscure when the former employs “medicine” in addition to prayers, invocations, and the preparation of charms or a drink which he makes from ink when he washes off his writing board. Although these wonder-working mallamai are represented in several Chadian ethnic [Page 155] groups, those among the pilgrims enjoy a higher prestige than their fellows."
t0270 cite0160 MS14 "Modu prayed at least several hours a day until the wedding night, but to no avail. He later admitted to intimate household members that he was at first unable to reach an erection. Therefore, in the middle of the night, he visited a senior medicine specialist in the village. This worthy told him that no one could ever impregnate this particular young girl because he, the medicine man, had “closed her up” for Ali when Ali had been rejected as her first husband. The matter was now closed and for a small fee he would “open her” again. He gave the anxious groom some medicine and Modu returned and consummated his marriage successfully."
t0270 cite0160 MS14 "In the cases of impotence over the same girl described above, both men knew there was a history of “bad feeling” over this girl. The possibility that malevolence might be involved was very much enhanced in such an atmosphere. Thus the normal anxiety over the semi-public display of one’s manhood was heightened by the knowledge that someone had in fact not wanted this marriage to take place—and might have done something supernatural to prevent it. In such a charged climate, two successive cases of impotency are not surprising, and the medicine specialist did well to calm things down by admitting to the reality of the malevolence. Indeed, in taking credit for it, he created and enhanced his credibility to the point where he could believably withdraw the “spell.”"
t0271 cite0161 MS14 "He was anxious about the gift and so went to an expert on medicines who gave him a couple of special kola nuts whose magical love potion power would direct the woman to find him irresistible. His confidence thus buoyed up, he visited her himself and they had a short affair. He tasted her cooking, observed her behavior, and after two weeks sent a friend to the older brother to arrange for the marriage payments. Three weeks later, after the marriage was proposed to the luwali, (in this case her older brother), the couple were married."
t0272 cite0161 MS14 "When the infant arrives it is washed, then warmed almost continuously by the women in attendance who heat their hands over a dish of hot coals and then press the body of the child gently. Almost immediately there are attempts to have the child feed at the mother’s breast. At the same time the placenta is buried in the compound with no ceremony. If it fails to descend, one of the women in attendance hastens to a local religious practitioner or a medicinal expert who gives medicines to bring it down. All adult men, including the husband, are barred from any direct participation in the birth event. Instead they usually pray during the entire birth along with their friends and a religious practitioner who may have been hired especially for this purpose."
t0273 cite0161 MS14 "The butcher’s craft, although lucrative in relation to other activities like Ka’anami’s or blacksmithing, is a low status occupation, and many butchers including Mala Bukar are quick to say that [Page 84] their families were not butchers in times past but conditions have forced them to “take up the knife.” The craft requires anatomical knowledge of animals and a skilled use of the knife to cut and clean them. Besides this it necessitates continuous relations with cattle owners, many of whom are Shuwa and Fulani nomads who wander through the area."
t0274 cite0033 FF57 "The practice of medicine is closely associated with magic, but just as not every mishap is due to a supernatural cause, so not every medicine is a magic medicine. Medicines are divided into three classes: First, there are a few simples [sic] which can be used by anybody without formality, as for instance the alufu grass (see p. 35) used for stopping bleeding. These are called ‘sword medicine’ ( icigh ki shmough ). Secondly, there are some which must be ‘bought’, but are not connected with an akombo , such as certain herbs used to cure gonorrhoea. The third kind, and far the biggest, are the akombo medicines. These can only be applied by a man who has control of the particular akombo to which they belong, but even when he has been fully initiated he must pay a further fee for the right to administer them. This classification, however, is not based entirely on the type of medicine or treatment employed, but also depends to some extent on the nature of the disease and the circumstances in which it was contracted. Even the herbs in the first class can only be applied without original payment of a fee if used as a cure for simple cuts or wounds which a man may get accidentally in the course of his normal avocations. They cannot so be used in connexion with an operation like circumcision. In this case, as seen in the first chapter, the practitioner must buy the right, not only to perform the operation, but also to give the prescribed after-treatment, even though this may consist merely in the application of remedies which at other times he is in the habit of using without any such restrictions."
t0274 cite0033 FF57 "Thus for every akombo right, and for every kind of medical or 210 surgical treatment, except a few ‘household’ remedies in everyday use, there is a fee laid down, both that which the patient must pay the doctor and also that which the doctor must pay for the right to practise. This fee must be paid to ensure success, whether the treatment is purely pathological or whether it is wholly or partly magical. But there is an important distinction between ‘natural’ and ‘supernatural’ treatment (using the words in a European sense) with regard to the initial qualifications of the practitioner. The right to do operations, such as circumcision or teeth-cutting, and to use the non-magical medicines mentioned in the second category, has only to be bought ( yam ), but no man may perform the magic rites or apply the herbs or treatment of the third category unless he has obtained control ( k[unknown]r ) or the particular akombo concerned by undergoing initiation. It is held by some of the Tiv, probably correctly, that the latter class of treatments is indigenous, whereas those which need only be bought have been copied from other peoples in comparatively recent times. It should, however, be emphasized that in every department of life, and more especially in the practice of medicine, the line between the natural and the supernatural is very faintly drawn, and that even in the case of those treatments and operations which have no especial magical significance in themselves, the unseen forces are felt to be very near at hand, waiting for a chance to make things go wrong. For this reason, no important operation is undertaken, or treatment applied, without every precaution being taken against their intervention."
t0275 cite0035 FF57 "The akombo igbo is performed as follows:--The practitioner is called and he makes the igbo, some six pieces of grass folded over at the ends, into a bundle about a foot long and places it on the ground near a stone. He then takes a chicken and touches the stone, the igbo, and the woman (on the chest and back) with it, and then twirls it round her head six times. Then he kills the chicken by cutting its throat and puts blood on the stone, on the igbo, and on the woman’s navel. The chicken is then cooked and brought with yam food (ruam) and the practitioner takes a morsel of yam food, and the legs and head of the chicken, and puts morsels on the stone and on the igbo. Then he throws a morsel east saying ‘iyange wan nomso’ (the sun is a young man), and a morsel west saying ‘uwer wan kwase’ (the moon is a young woman), after which he takes a morsel and puts it to the woman’s lips and, taking it away, feeds it to a male, not her husband. The practitioner then pours out a mixture of flour and water (mwem) on the stone and on the igbo and then puts the igbo in the roof of the woman’s hut and the ceremony is at an end.”"
t0275 cite0035 FF57 "“The akombo a gbande is nearly always performed for a woman with child; this is a ceremony for the expulsion of evil and is carried out as follows:--The woman kneels on one knee in front of the practitioner, and a ram or male goat is taken by him and he touches her breast with it, each time repeating one of the following formula:--..."
t0276 cite0035 FF57 "“The other important akombo performed for women with child is called the akombo swende. It is an act for the expulsion of evil and the transference of it into the body of a scape-goat. It is always performed by a male slave who must always disappear immediately afterwards; some say that he was driven away in the past. It is performed as follows:--A male slave is called, who is a practitioner of the akombo, and he takes a cock, a dog, a piece of iron and a pot of gruel which no woman must have touched."
t0276 cite0035 FF57 "He goes down with these to a stream, the woman following. The woman stands in the stream, up stream, and the slave ties a string round her neck and another round her waist. He places a leaf of wild pawpaw (hur) on either bank, puts mud on them and pours gruel on them. Then he takes the cock and leaf in his right hand, and another leaf in his left, and touches the leaves on either bank with these. Then he touches the woman on the chest and back with them and twirls the cock round her head saying:--(I am performing the rites of Swende to-day for you; in case you have touched a man killed by accident; in case you have talked with a Swende practitioner; or in case you have killed a dog or stepped over a dog’s bone). He then stoops and splashes water down stream with the chicken and leaves, saying ‘ibo sen, ibo sen’, (evil flow away, evil flow away); then turning and splashing towards the woman he says:--‘isho kondo, isho kondo’ (virtue flow up, virtue flow up). He then kills the cock by dashing its head on a stone and, taking out the crop, puts in on the leaf on the right bank. Then he kills the dog by dashing its head on the stone and throws away the body to flow away on the water, or, if the stream is nearly dry, into the bush. He then takes mud from the stream and puts it on the woman’s navel, cuts the strings and throws them in the stream. Finally he takes water from the stream in the leaf and sprinkles the woman, and the akombo is at an end. The slave must go away as quickly as possible; if he should enter the compound of the woman disaster is said to be certain."
t0277 cite0162 FF57 "There is another aspect of the continuity of akombo : namely, the notion that they are regarded as a progression to the good things of life. Reference here is to what has been called in the literature akombo biamegh and po’or. Biamegh is a grand ceremony that will involve not only one’s kin, or only the clan, but the entire Tiv land. When biamegh is celebrated (very rarely, for the expense is great), akombo specialists from all over the land will come to the place where it is being held, and the proceedings are likely to last for several days. Po’or is the name given to a bin in which, according to the old lore, human heads were kept. Again there are big rites connected with it. Both biamegh and po’or are what the Tiv call akombo-a-tamen (‘great’ akombo ), which directly involve social groups and not individuals, and are concerned with such matters as possession of land, not with illness. The ramifications involved are complicated, and the writer is not equipped to go into them. 1 The point to be made here is that there is a positive notion of continuity with the other akombo. Biamegh and po’or are looked upon as extensions which cannot be entered until all the other akombo are completed by an individual or by his father in the way that has been described. With these two ‘great’ akombo we are moving away from pure ‘disease’ to questions of social control. In fact one akombo specialist, in contradistinction to other akombo specialists and to the literature, did not consider biamegh and po’or to be akombo at all. Akombo, he said, meant ‘sickness’, but biamegh had to do with good clothes and enjoyment, property and so on—good things generally. The merging of concepts of disease with others concerning acquisition of property, status, and control is a complexity that would take much further research to unravel. Some general line of progression, however, is quite clear."
t0278 cite0163 MS30 "Wolof women, however, do not always compete in the socially accepted fashion. When a wife finds that another is surpassing her in her husband’s affection, she may resort to magic, much of which is malicious and is disapproved of by the community. Jealous wives go to a practitioner of magic ( wanyankat) who uses pagan techniques, to have him work a form of magic called n[unknown]t[unknown]l designed to make it impossible for the rival to remain in one place for any length of time, and thus cause her to leave the village. The practitioner of magic ties a charm on the foot of a vulture to make the victim travel whenever the bird flies somewhere. A socially accepted charm called baire is commonly worn to win the love of husbands and to eliminate competition. This contains either a verse of the Koran, called alam nasara laka, 16 or a powder made of ground herbs which is pagan magic. But most of the magic is illicit and distinctly malevolent: There are medicines which cause the [Page 122] rival to divorce the husband, which prevent her from having children, make her ill, or even bring about her death. One called dedeli (to separate) destroys the love of the husband for her. A woman about to be married to a man who already has a spouse is said to practice magic against her future cowife; and a bride takes precautions against the evil machinations of the first wife or other wives. The more violent forms of black magic, especially frowned on by pious Mohammedans, are probably not much used. However, they are well known and precautions are taken against them to be on the safe side. Most of the use of magic by the women seems to have the beneficial effect of giving vent to stored-up resentments without doing much actual harm."
t0279 cite0164 MS30 "Certain natives, served by a good memory and a livelier intelligence, took an interest in these traditions and legends to the extent of learning those of /120/ neighboring families and even of neighboring kingdoms and little by little acquired a reputation as specialists in these matters. Fara Penda was one of them, and even today Yoro Dyâo, who has inherited this same reputation, speaks only with veneration about the knowledge of his father. The knowledge of French that he acquired at the School for Hostages enabled Yoro to take notes on his father’s narrations and later on those of the griots and the old men to whose narrations he listened. It was with the help of these notes, and for the sole purpose of preserving his recollections for himself, that he drew up the two notebooks that follow, without imagining that they might one day be published. We thank him for being willing to entrust them to us and to give us the supplementary information that seemed to us necessary for understanding them."
t0280 cite0165 MS30 "Among the Wolof, most of the occasions when distant ancestors or matrilateral ties are discussed involve genealogical specialists from the griot caste (the gewel). Remembering the more complicated aspects of genealogy is supposed to be the griot’s responsibility. Some few non- griot elders, male and female, can produce partial genealogies for their own families, or they may offer an opinion on a griot’s performance. But these elders are invariably weak on matrilateral ties, and they are likely to disclaim responsibility for knowing or for recounting the more distant relationships. When nobles do discuss genealogy among themselves, the discussion is usually limited to fairly close relationships among living individuals, in which the genealogical background is not more than two or three generations deep. The kind of discussion Blount reports for the Luo-a discussion among elders concerning distant relationships among their own families-does not occur here."
t0280 cite0165 MS30 "There are two kinds of occasions when griots present historical information: formal recital (called woy, or praise singing) and informal conversation ( waxtan). 7 There are several differences between the two events. First, praise singing is the exclusive prerogative of the gewel, a special service for which they can demand immediate public payment. Second, the two events differ as to whether the genealogy is presented in formal or informal manner. The formality of praise singing consists mainly in the style of delivery and the application of certain structural conventions. Praise-songs usually include some passages whose text is fixed and learned by heart, but fixity of text is not the main criterion distinguishing formal from informal testimony, for such passages are not the most important part of the recital and can be deleted."
t0280 cite0165 MS30 "The scheduling and setting of the two speech events tend to differ also. There is no particular moment that is better than any other for informal conversation about genealogies, except that people are most likely to want to discuss genealogy when they are contemplating a marriage, considering litigation that involves genealogical claims, or asking for financial assistance or political support on grounds of kinship. The conversation usually occurs inside the hut or room of the person whose genealogy is being discussed. The occasion is quite private, and other griots are not likely to attend."
t0280 cite0165 MS30 "In contrast, formal praise singing usually takes place in more public settings and in scheduled, large-scale events. The most usual occasion for praise singing is a feast that someone has sponsored for an important family event or for one of the Muslim holidays. These feasts, to which the village at large and many people from surrounding villages are invited, are important in maintaining the reputation of the host as a person of wealth, generosity, and pride in his family. The feasts are also opportunities for outsiders to visit a village, see and hear evidence of the host’s family background, and propose a marital alliance. The recital of praise-songs affirms the host’s generosity toward his griot dependents (who display the cash they have been given as they sing), while it celebrates his genealogical claims."
t0280 cite0165 MS30 "Another difference between the two speech events is their availability and frequency. Because conversation about genealogies takes place in private, whereas praise singing occurs in public, any Wolof villager may witness most of the praise-songs but only a few of the conversations. In particular, the younger griots who are still learning the historical information [Page 657] attend many public praise-songs-almost every day, at the height of the season-but they rarely attend informal conversations on genealogy with non- griots, because only older griots qualify as “experts.” Praise singing is also more frequent, because many griots prefer it. A griot summoned for a private, informal talk, when he arrives may launch into a formal performance instead. (Although praise singing is normally associated with feasts, special settings are not actually a prerequisite. Griots can decide to perform anywhere, even in a private room. That the griot begins to perform in the formal style is sufficient to define the event as praise singing.)"
t0280 cite0165 MS30 "Finally, the two speech events differ in the kind of discourse that can occur in them. Although I will examine discourse in both events, I must note from the outset that the formal event probably has greater significance for the transmission of historical tradition because of its frequency and its accessibility to the younger generation of griots."
t0281 cite0165 MS30 "As a result, the interests of the Wolof performer are not identical with the interests of the individual who is the subject of the genealogical discourse (his patron), as they might be in a society where genealogy is recounted by a political contender himself (as among the Tiv and the Luo). Rather, the griot has his own reputation to promote as well, and other patrons to attract. If a griot wants to ensure that his performance for one patron does not alienate others who may be present in the audience, his willingness to distort a genealogy in that person’s favor may be much reduced. And at the same time there is a definite advantage to be gained from presenting a detailed, clear, and convincing genealogy, for the griot’s personal and professional reputation rests largely on whether he is considerd to be truthful and knowledgeable. Such griots are thought to be morally superior to others, and they command the highest fees and the greatest number of patrons because whatever genealogical claims they make for a patron are more likely to be believed...."
t0281 cite0165 MS30 "Still another consequence seems to be a pressure on the griot to avoid telling lies, and to confine his manipulations of the pedigree to exploiting ambiguities, tracing only desirable lines, and omitting undesirable materials. Comparison of genealogies given by different griots and comments made by other informants suggest that, indeed, actual alteration of specific detail is rare compared to other ways of casting genealogies to someone’s advantage. Contradictions are few."
t0282 cite0166 MS30 "The Wolof make use of most available medication and medical practitioners–modern, Muslim, or traditional. Nearly all Wolof wear numerous amulets that are believed to have the power to protect the wearer from illness, evil spirits, witchcraft, or other harm. The most common function of marabouts at the village level is to make these amulets, which consist of passages from the Quran written on slips of paper encased in leather packets. The shaman (jabarkat) may also be hired to make amulets, in which case the leather casings contain pieces of magical roots or leaves."
t0283 cite0125 AA01 "One also finds, as in all other Buddhist lands, bonzesses living together in convents not far from the pagodas where they are forbidden to reside. Like the bonzes, they are supposed to remain continent during their stay in the bonzeries, and the penalty of death awaits those who give birth to children. For this reason, it is maintained, they are greatly skilled in the infamous art of abortion. Their morals have the reputation of being abominable. For the rest, bonzes and bonzesses are perfectly free to leave their convents and monasteries whenever they wish and return to public life, and this is a very frequent occurrence. People enter these hostels because they do not know what else to do, and if they grow tired of the life after a more or less long stay, they leave and go to seek their fortune elsewhere."
t0284 cite0167 AA01 "Besides women of these lower orders there are others that never cover the face and who, although entirely respectable, may be seen by men without reproach. These are, lady physicians, of whom there are many in Korea, and the blind female exorcists. Women of the upper middle class or even of the highest class may enter the medical profession and if so they are exempt from the restrictions which hedge in their sisters. It is said that many Korean female doctors are very expert at acupuncture which is about all the surgery of which the Esculapian art can boast in Korea."
t0285 cite0168 AA01 "Besides the medical cures, the people also resort to lay practitioners with special reputations for curative powers. There are also many 44 popular herbal remedies generally known to most persons. Castor oil, for example, is a simple physic procured from home-grown plants. The flower and top stem of opium poppies may be boiled and drunk when someone has diarrhea or dysentery. Some of the local practices seem much more novel. For instance, a fisherman says that for venereal disease he seeks out a live baby lizard about an inch and a half long and wraps it in the sticky underside of a soybean leaf. Folding over the ends of the leaf, he places this pastille on the back of his tongue, and swallows it without benefit of liquid. I contented myself with carefully checking on the fact that this treatment was not unique, but did not try it myself. But after all, perhaps a lizard accumulates penicillin from the soil. One way in which malaria is thought to be cured is by licking human excrement; another is to have the sufferer led around by a relative who shouts. ‘Buy malaria!’ The clinicians recommend quinine."
t0286 cite0168 AA01 "In the third quarter of the fifteenth century, a hospital was founded to care for those suffering from indigestion, a medical bureau was established, and Korean treatises on medicine were published. Previous to that time it would seem that the only authoritative medical works were the traditional Chinese texts, of which the first is attributed to the legendary Emperor Shen Nung in the third 268 millennium B. C. With the advent of the Yi dynasty, however, the accumulated experience of Korean practitioners began to be recognized although laymen still distinguished between the doctors who could read classical Chinese and those who could not."
t0286 cite0168 AA01 "Treatment consisted mainly of prescribing drugs, most of which were concocted from medicinal herbs and a touch of flavoring, but sometimes ingredients were added which strikes one as strange indeed from the standards of an empirical pharmacopoeia. Surgery was comprised almost wholly of acupuncture undertaken after the examination of the pulse. Then, following various theories and charts, the needle or other sharp instrument was inserted at some point of the body and withdrawn. Instead of this method, surgeons on occasion substituted an application of heat, either by employing a hot poultice or by burning one or more cones, usually made of the crushed stalk of mugwort (Artemesia), at certain places on the body. Needless to say, lacking anesthetics, this type of surgery, like any other, was not pleasant."
t0001 cite0040 AD05 "Treatment of disease and injury [colds, flu] may involve many distinct techniques. There are a great variety of professional medical practitioners such as Western-style doctors, traditional Chinese doctors, various folk specialties such as acupuncture, different shamans, and temple priests who furnish charms to drink. Most professionals are males but [Page 95] midwives are invariably females."
t0001 cite0040 AD05 "In addition to the professionals, there are local village amateurs. I cut my bare foot on a piece of bamboo in a rice paddy and it became badly infected. Two old villagers, an unrelated male and female, collected certain grasses in the mountain, chewed them thoroughly to make a soft wet lump which they applied to the cut as a poultice. The wound healed very quickly. Old age seems to be a prime characteristic of local medical specialists (non-professional) who are consulted regularly as experts."
t0001 cite0040 AD05 "Certain diseases and injuries are considered best treated by particular kinds of practitioners. There is considerable agreement on diagnosing and recommended treatment in the village. For example, a Chinese herb doctor is Hsin Tien is best for a broken bone and a Western doctor, for eye infections."
t0001 cite0040 AD05 "Self diagnosis and treatment is common. Although several older people in Talei Li are considered to have special medical abilities, most adults are amateur health practitioners. Itinerant salesmen leave bags containing [Page 96] a variety of different traditional and modern medicines hanging on the walls in houses. People use what they desire and when the salesman returns he replaces missing items and charges for them although there is no charge if none have been used. Different salesmen provide different combinations of drugs. There are 134 such medicine bags distributed among 59 of the 66 village households."
t0002 cite0040 AD05 "Tradition is important. Some people, particularly older ones, are considered to have such expertise with regard to cultural norms that acceptance of their authoritative interpretation of norms is frequent and natural. For example, a recently married woman wanted to go see her sister's new baby but knew there was some avoidance rule involving brides and babies. After learning from an older woman that a bride brought misfortune to a baby less than 30 days old, she willingly accepted the ruling and did not even seem disappointed. In many cases, there is this quite willing acceptance of custom for its own sake."
t0002 cite0040 AD05 "In summary, it appears that women are not significant on an overt level for social control in the contexts discussed in this chapter. They do not really participate in formal rule, politics, or most political units. Their effects are more covert. They influence men and are extremely significant in the socialization process which builds into individuals the internal mechanisms of social control."
t0003 cite0040 AD05 "As previously stated, it is hoped the first child will be a boy and boys will continue to be desired following the first child until the desired number is acquired. There are rituals to change the sex of the unborn child from female to male, some performed by the family and others by specialists, but villagers do not believe them very effective. It is also possible to detect the sex by various means such as computations involving the mother's age and month of conception."
t0004 cite0041 AD05 "At the onset of a cold or flu, a number of people now go either to a doctor or to a shot specialist in order to get a penicillin shot. It should be explained that there are people whose main job is to give injections of one or another drug; the village shot specialist in K'un Shen also gives shots to induce abortion. The village school provides smallpox vaccinations and treatment for trachoma. The use of doctors trained in modern medicine has also increased. There is an afternoon clinic, conducted by a doctor who commutes from Tainan for the half-day. It is now felt by many that certain illnesses are best cured by a doctor, if not in the village, then in a city hospital or clinic. These illnesses include tuberculosis, polio, malaria, cholera, meningitis (which is very commonly epidemic among young children), leprosy, flu (Asian and otherwise), diphtheria, serious animal bites, and asthma. Broken bones or sprains are not normally treated by a doctor; there are bonesetters in the city who specialize in this. For a time one of the village barberships had a dentist."
t0005 cite0043 AD05 "As indicated earlier in this chapter, magic requires a distinctive type of ritual in Hsin Hsing village supernaturalism. Perhaps the most important single use for magical ritual in the Hsin Hsing area is the curing of illness. As we noted above, the increased availability of Western medicine, especially since the early 1950's, the accessibility of practitioners trained in these ways, and the evidences of their success have turned the villagers more and more away from traditional practices, at least as the major and usually the initial source of help. Thus, the villager now tends to turn to the magical ritual only when he feels that modern science has failed him. However, it remains true that the traditional ritualistic patterns fulfill social, psychological, and even therapeutic functions beyond what is possible for the scientific."
t0005 cite0043 AD05 "There is no particular problem with illnesses which can be clearly diagnosed as natural or supernatural. But there are many cases in which the diagnosis is not so easy or clear-cut. Mainly, the villagers rely on past experience to tell them which set of symptoms indicates which category of illness, and thus which kind of practitioner to call in. Naturally, there are considerable variations among the villagers themselves which may predispose a decision in one direction or the other -- level of education, amount of experience, financial ability, and even types of social pressure. As one would expect, the actual availability of drugs and doctors affects choice. In recent years the dependence upon Western medicines and Western-oriented doctors has increased as a result of the increased supply of both at relatively low cost. The ease of access to antibiotics and patent medicines, their effectiveness, and the doctors' record of successes have given confidence in Western science, with the result that it is common today for the villagers to turn to Western methods first for most illnesses."
t0005 cite0043 AD05 "The attitude of the villagers toward the old and new medicine is a useful example of the way in which practical, external factors can affect “folk” beliefs and values. Here availability, finances, and family circumstances have combined to promote the acceptance of a new body of knowledge. The rural community of the Hsin Hsing area has accepted Western medicine without damage to its value structure or to its beliefs, incorporating the new quite comfortably into the old framework. Thus, when the villager calls upon a Western-style medical practitioner first of all, and the illness is not cured, he can still reinterpret the symptoms and assume that the cause was supernatural after all -- perhaps possession by a demon. Then, to cope with the supernatural, he calls in a shaman."
t0006 cite0169 AD05 "Although patron-client relationships are an extremely significant pattern in much of Taiwanese political life in high government circles and also in rural areas (Crissman 1969, Gallin 1968), they are not of great importance in Prosperity Settlement. People in the Settlement come, at times, to wealthy or knowledgeable neighbors for a loan or for help in accomplishing something outside the client's sphere of competence. The client may need information on good medical treatment, or help with transacting government-related business. Community leaders usually give aid where they can; to do otherwise would injure their reputations, but there are several wealthy families who are relatively uninvolved in such relationships."
t0007 cite0170 AD05 "Social and mental problems (except for psychosis) and non-medical problems are rarely taken to Western-style doctors if there are other practitioners available. Some are no doubt solved through discussions with friends and relatives; others are unresolved till death. Still others, which are best discussed under the classes of the “old-fashioned” taxonomy, are taken to religious and folk practitioners whose methods of description, diagnosis, and treatment are considered more appropriate to such problems...."
t0007 cite0170 AD05 "The second class in native taxonomy -- “caused from your own body” -- may include almost any in the Western list of ailments (1-4). They will all be handled primarily with herbs, hû-á, and dietary prescriptions. They may be further explained by reference to hot, cold, and poison, to body processes. Occasionally Ong-ia-kong will also warn the person away from funerals. Other practitioners of sacred medicine who do not dispense herbs would refer an illness “from the body” to a doctor of Chinese or Western medicine...."
t0007 cite0170 AD05 "According to the mothers I interviewed, the only one of these problems which is ever taken to a Western-style doctor is fright. I was told by Taipei doctors that the usual treatment is phenobarbital. The other supernatural grievances go exclusively to Chinese sacred medical practitioners, though the illnesses they cause are often treated with Western and Chinese secular medicine...."
t0007 cite0170 AD05 "The villagers make use of the concepts of harmony and patching, along with numerous others from Chinese and Western medicine, to decide which medical system to start with when a person falls ill, and when and how to move between systems. The resultant pattern of multiple use relies heavily on self-diagnosis. Some diseases are considered appropriate for Western medicine (appendicitis, syphilis), some for Chinese secular medicine (rheumatism, broken bones), some for Chinese sacred medicine (fright, nightmares). However, most diseases can be seen as having aspects appropriate for treatment in more than one of the different systems. When a disease is seen by only one practitioner (of any type), it is most probably because it disappeared very rapidly rather than because the native taxonomic theory specified the system to which the complaint was appropriate...."
t0007 cite0170 AD05 "The Western doctor in diagnosis uses a body of medical theory which is largely inaccessible to the patient. He rarely attempts to explain even the simplest parts of it: transmission of disease, purpose of test, side effects of medicine. He often does not even name the disease or the drugs or tell why he is doing what he does. The doctor plays no other role in the patient's life and pays no attention to the other aspects of the patient's life. Most doctors said they did not ask whether a woman was pregnant or ask about the home situation. Many problems having bearing on a patient's illness or state of mind are not considered relevant to Western medicine and are not brought up by either doctor or patient. Oral treatment is generally given on a daily basis so that the patient must return to get more medicine, instead of being instructed and then allowed to carry out his own treatment at home. The patient is questioned, manipulated, and injected as an object. In the end, the doctor's interaction with the patient often does not make the patient feel any better. He goes home not knowing what is wrong with him, what the doctor did or why, what the medicine he is taking is called and what it is likely to do to him. There is nothing he himself can do for his illness except finish taking the medicine and return to the doctor, or seek out a different practitioner. I don't know if this professional remoteness is modelled on traditional Chinese practice or is a product of Western training. However, it characterizes every Western doctor I met in Taiwan."
t0008 cite0045 AD05 "The Japanese established medical schools as early as 1902. They instituted licensing of local doctors and midwives and provided elementary instruction in western medicine to many Taiwanese practitioners. Although the training was apparently quite superficial, it was extensive enough to have a dramatic impact on the mortality rate."
t0008 cite0045 AD05 "During their stay in Taiwan, the Japanese made considerable efforts to discourage the practice of Chinese secular medicine. In 1897, just two years after their arrival, they held an examination for doctors of traditional Chinese medicine with ten years' experience. Every candidate passed the examination and received official permission to continue in practice, but after that time no further permits were issued. As a result, after two or three [Page 12] decades, with the deaths of the older members of the profession and the absence of new members, the number of officially sanctioned practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine declined rapidly and by 1945 had sunk to approximately thirty to forty on the whole island."
t0008 cite0045 AD05 "By 1925, the Japanese considered western medicine on Taiwan so advanced that it could take over the entire health care of the population. They launched a new and rather severe cultural program to further restrict the practice of any type of traditional secular medicine. This [Page 13] program was curtailed by Japan's involvement in World War II, since modern medicines and doctors were needed for the Japanese army. There was increased reliance in Taiwan on Chinese traditional practitioners; but there were severe limitations on the import of traditional drugs from the Mainland, and increased use of indigenous Taiwanese remedies in their place. This situation persisted until the Mainlanders took over in the forties. (Unschuld, 1976:4)"
t0009 cite0045 AD05 "One practitioner we interviewed was a bone-setter. Since people believe that Chinese medicine is better for broken bones, he and his co-specialists have a virtual monopoly. There are, according to him, about twenty other bone-setters in Tapu; we saw only five. Our man has a very visible office on a main street, and is under contract to the railroad -- he is by far the busiest bone-setter in town. Most of his patients are working-class males, especially those engaged in housebuilding. He practices bone-setting and massage and dispenses herbs according to ancestral prescriptions. He said he was not allowed to prescribe herbs except in connection with broken bones, but it is thought that proper therapy of broken bones requires both internal and external application of herbs. The bone-setter is a member of the Association of Chinese Gymnastics, and runs a gymnasium in addition to his bone-setting establishment. Since he does not have a license to practice as a Chinese doctor, he refers serious cases to Taita Hospital so that no one will die under his care."
t0010 cite0045 AD05 "A person who has exhausted the Chinese secular resources of Tapu will consult neighbors about unusual herb cures or try out-of-the-way practitioners. For instance, in a very small town south of Tapu lived a family with an ancient and secret recipe for curing acute athlete's foot. A laborer who was actually disabled with athlete's foot had found this family after trying western doctors in Tapu and Taipei and Chinese doctors in Tapu."
t0010 cite0045 AD05 "Chinese secular medical resources do not form a hierarchy or really any regular structure at all. There is no organization which holds the practitioners of Chinese medicine together, no conferences to keep doctors up to date, no coordination with public health, no uniformity of training, and no association even to set fees. Though there does exist in Taiwan a strong political lobbying group for Chinese medicine, none of these doctors participates. It is mainly an organization of Mainlanders which carries on its activities in Taipei in circles which never touch these men."
t0011 cite0045 AD05 "But Chinese sacred medicine shares virtually nothing with the western-style medicine practiced in Taiwan. It is practiced in temples or in front of household altars with the smoke of incense, candles, and burning spirit money and the sound of chants, instrumental music, and firecrackers. The practitioners are often the old, blind, and lame. Their remuneration is considered a gift, not a payment. Their equipment makes no attempt to resemble the scientific and they have no official sanction or regulation. Training is through apprenticeship or revelation. The herbs prescribed are often those growing wild by the rivers or in the mountains. And the behavior of spirits is important in most diagnoses and treatments."
t0011 cite0045 AD05 "What I call the sacred medical tradition is an amalgamation of the concepts of China's great traditions of Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, combined with folk religion, translated into practice, and expressed symbolically with ritual and everyday objects. The folk tradition [Page 91] has generated its own specialists to minister to perceived medical needs which are not met elsewhere. In addition to the health problems that are familiar to western readers, Taiwanese suffer from several ailments which may be loosely classed as supernatural."
t0012 cite0045 AD05 "Our final practitioner of sacred medicine in Tapu is called Sien-si n Ma. Her patients are almost entirely infants and young children suffering from fright and, occasionally, T'u-sha. She is a woman in her late sixties [Page 108] or early seventies, who, with her husband and one daughter-in-law, runs a small general store at the foot of the mountain. In the room adjoining the store -- hardly a room, it is merely separated by shelves -- is an altar with an assortment of the usual gods (Kuan Yin, Matsu, Kuan Kung), incense pots, and the like. On the side is a small table holding the three types of powdered herbal medicine she uses, and the incense and spirit money for her rituals. Outside the shop is a cool, shaded veranda running along a large ditch. Many people pass by her store, and school children stop to buy sweets. A mother, often accompanied by her husband or mother-in-law, brings in a baby or young child. Usually the complaint is that the child has not been sleeping or eating well, or has fever, diarrhea, or a cold. Often the child has already been to a doctor, and the medicine has not worked as expected. Sometimes the child has exhibited strange crying, unaccompanied by the symptoms that would make it appropriate to see a doctor."
t0012 cite0045 AD05 "Sien-si n Ma takes the baby on her lap, unwraps it to look into its eyes, ears, and mouth, feels its chest and belly, and sometimes its spine or shoulder bones. She pours a little boiled water from a thermos into a rice bowl on the table next to her. Putting a wad of cotton into the water, she rubs the baby's gums with it. Then she dips her finger into one or two of her herb powders and rubs that on the baby's gums. She then rewraps the baby, [Page 109] hands it back to the mother, but keeps some blanket or piece of the baby's clothing that the mother has brought. The mother sits on the stool while Sien-si n Ma lights the altar candles and the incense and begins to chant."
t0012 cite0045 AD05 "In the chant she calls upon Kuan Yin, Matsu, Wu Nien, Ch'ien Sui, and Kuan Kung. She asks the gods to send the soul back to the baby. She tells the parents' name and address, and the age and sibling order of the baby. She lights some spirit money at the altar, and then, facing the doorway, burns some on the floor. While it burns, she continues to chant and swings the patient's clothes over the burning money. She tells the mother to call the patient's name and tell it to come back. The mother calls three or more times. Then Sien-si n Ma throws the divination blocks to determine whether the soul has returned as requested. If she gets a negative answer, the mother continues calling, and Sien-si n Ma continues chanting. She tries the blocks again until she gets a positive answer. When that occurs, she takes a pinch of the ashes and puts it on the clothing, another pinch for the baby's forehead. She returns to the altar, chants a bit more, and splashes some water on the clothes. She burns one more pile of spirit money near the altar and instructs the mother, carrying the baby and holding some of the incense sticks, to step over the spirit-money fire. Then Sien-si n Ma returns the baby's clothes to the mother, who wraps them around the baby. Sien-si n Ma is now finished, [Page 110] and usually goes to sit down. The mother puts some small amount of money somewhere on the table and takes her baby home."
t0013 cite0045 AD05 "Fortune-tellers inform the parents of the gates or barriers the child must cross. Sometimes this is related to the prohibitions mentioned above. For example, it is sometimes said that if the child must cross the King of Hell gate he cannot go to his mother's natal home. More common are references to the fire, vehicle, and water gates, discussed in Chapter III. If the child must cross such a gate, then he is in danger from that source: he may be burned, hit by a train or taxi, or drowned. A particularly serious case of measles was explained as due to the fact that the child had to cross the “measles gate”. Taoists, spirit mediums, and other ritual specialists at temples and altars are often busy getting supplicants through or across such gates."
t0013 cite0045 AD05 "Apparently faith in these procedures is not very strong. Although some people thought it was good to have these ceremonies performed, others, like Chia Sio-chin, thought it was better not to take the child's fortune at all because it would just make you worry about this or that barrier. There must be considerable doubt that crossing barriers with a Taoist really assures the child any safeth, if the mother would willingly choose to risk the child's life rather than have the ceremony performed. Sim So-chu expressed distress that, although they had had the child's fortune told at birth, when she took the baby to a Taoist for spiritual treatment of a later problem, the [Page 158] practitioner said there were barriers for the child which the original fortune-teller hadn't mentioned. The mothers didn't know which person to believe."
t0014 cite0045 AD05 "We have seen that the Tapu area includes many different practitioners, each offering a particular kind of care, each with its own style and its own specialties. Each of these practitioners is quite busy treating clients. But care offered by the Wang Yeh Kung tang-ki seemed to me the most comprehensive, the most able to treat the whole person and the most coordinated with the other medical possibilities...."
t0014 cite0045 AD05 "As mentioned above, most people do not go exclusively to one medical practitioner or even restrict themselves to one medical system. Any illness which is not cured quickly at home, or does not respond to primary care, or occurs in conjunction with other problems, or appears in any way strange or complex, may prompt the patient or his family to seek secondary care. This leads to a complex interweaving of the separate strands we have discussed in this chapter; this interweaving is the subject of the next chapter."
t0014 cite0045 AD05 "Against this general pattern of infrequent referrals within the sacred medical system, Wang Yeh Kung is an exception. He refers more frequently than most other sacred practitioners, and his referrals are regarded in a highly positive light. For one thing, he always supplies some treatment himself, even when he refers. That is, he treats certain aspects of the problem (and that treatment is regarded as necessary) but explains that other aspects must be treated elsewhere. He does not withdraw himself from the patient's problem by sending the patient away; rather, he recommends additional treatment by another practitioner. Thus a pregnant woman concerned about the T'ai-shen will be given a fu for protection during pregnancy and be advised to deliver the baby at a large western hospital. (Obviously Wang Yen Kung does not deliver babies.) Most people who go to Wang Yeh Kung are also thinking of seeing western doctors. By referral, he directs them to a particular specialty (e.g., gynecologist, proctologist), a specific doctor, or to one of the several choices they were contemplating (e.g., hospital delivery vs. midwife delivery)."
t0014 cite0045 AD05 "Wang Yeh Kung can perform almost all the rituals of the small specialists and of the large temples, except of course the annual and monthly celebrations. He can [Page 222] answer questions far more satisfactorily than is possible with the divining blocks found in temples. And, most importantly, he is the only local sacred practitioner with knowledge of Chinese herb medicine. Unfortunately, one probably cannot generalize from this tang-ki to others -- I heard of no others who regularly prescribed such a wide range of medicines...."
t0014 cite0045 AD05 "The search for efficacy of cure is unlike doctor-hopping as it involves more conscious evaluation of practitioners and definite decisions for or against certain ones. It resembles movement to Taipei as, in both secular branches of medicine, Taipei is thought of as the [Page 224] place with the more efficacious practitioners, facilities, and cures. But efficacy ( ling ) is applied specifically to sacred religious medicine and therefore the search does not move to Taipei in particular but may take the patient almost anywhere in the island. A god who does not produce results is not ling; one who does is ling (even a god with humble or recent origins and a rustic or unadorned setting) and will soon have a loyal and growing clientele, as Wang Yeh Kung does...."
t0014 cite0045 AD05 "Furthermore, there are prohibitions and recommendations [relating to food and diet]. Some, like Wang Yeh Kung's persistent campaign against bananas, I regret."
t0015 cite0046 AD05 "When I knew her, A-bi was 16 years old, a normal Taiwanese adolescent except that she walked with a slight limp and did much more work than the average teenage girl. She had to, because she lived alone with her blind grandfather in the poorest housing in Ploughshare -- two dirt-floored rooms of an old mud-brick compound across the street from our house. A-bi's grandfather Tiu: Pun-a, made a little money as a medical practitioner -- he was reputed to be adept at setting bones and at curing injuries caused by falls, but living in an out-of-the-way place like Ploughshare he didn't have much business. So it seemed a good thing all around when A-bi went to work in an electronics factory near the market town of Shu-lin -- she worked the 4 p.m. to midnight shift, and the bus from the factory transported her both ways. But Pun-a's satisfaction turned to grave apprehension on February 21, when A-bi did not return on the midnight bus."
t0016 cite0171 AD05 "In Ploughshare, villagers have ties with practically all other villagers, and the network of dyadic links is much thicker within the village than outside of it. For major things, it is best to rely on kin, affines, or sworn kin. But for little everyday matters, people cooperate with anyone toward whom they have no active animosity. For example, I remember a village woman whose husband was ill, and who was told by a folk practitioner that he ought to eat the meat of a tho-ke , a chicken that had been allowed to forage and not been given any commercial chicken feed. She simply asked around the village until she found one."
t0017 cite0172 AD05 "Unfortunately, no study of differences in the use of different kinds of doctors is yet available. I can only offer evidence of another kind from a question asked of the same people represented in Table 1. They were asked what kind of professional help they thought they would seek for a variety of different kinds of ailments, from a skin rash to severe stomach pain. Despite the variation in attitudes disclosed in Table 1, practically the entire sample indicated they would make greater use of Western-style practitioners. Of course, this fact cannot be taken as evidence that most everyone actually makes more use of Western-style doctors; it is only an indication that the use of Western-style doctors is not insignificant even among those whose attitudes as described in Table 1 incline them toward Chinese-style medicine."
t0017 cite0172 AD05 "In this part of Taiwan, for the moment at least, a population of laymen with certain ideas about what disease is, confront one set of experts (Chinese-style doctors) with roughly similar ideas and another set of experts (Western-style doctors) with substantially different ideas."
t0018 cite0173 AD05 "One element in the villagers' attempt to find cures for illness is their concern about finding the cause of the illness. Anecdotal evidence of this is plentiful. One man who had been to several practitioners in an unsuccessful attempt to find relief from severe stomach pain exclaimed to me, “I can't stand it. Unless I can find out what the cause of this illness is, I don't know what cure to use. I'm completely at a loss.” In an effort to find out whether the importance this man gave to knowing [Page 100] the cause of an illness was widespread, I asked several questions to this point on a questionnaire administered informally to about 40 villagers. In one question 46 informants were asked to indicate which of eight factors they felt was most important in choosing a doctor. Sixteen (35 percent) chose the answer, “He explains the cause of an illness clearly.” No other single answer came close to this percentage. Another question was phrased as follows: “Suppose there are two doctors in the same town. It is equally convenient for you to go to either of them. One explains to you the cause of your sickness whereas the other just gives medicine with no explanation. Would you think it important to visit the one who gives explanations?” Forty of the 43 (93 percent of those responding to this question) gave a positive answer. Thirty-two of these 40 (80 percent) gave an emphatic answer such as, “It's very important to visit the doctor who gives explanations.” These answers indicate that many people regard finding out the cause of an illness as an important part of the process of seeing a doctor...."
t0018 cite0173 AD05 "Which kind of practitioner one seeks out depends on which kind of illness one suspects is involved. In general, illnesses caused from within the body are believed to be best treated by Western or Chinese-style doctors. ... They treat by administering medicine -- antibiotics, vitamins, etc. -- in the form of orally-taken powders or injections. Chinese-style doctors, also available to the Ch'inan villagers, diagnose with the help of feeling the pulse or studying the color of the complexion. They treat by administering herbs or other natural substances and by warning the patient away from certain foods, measures often designed to correct an imbalance of hot and cold. Although their methods are very different, both kinds of doctors are seen as being able to cure disease that arises from within the body...."
t0018 cite0173 AD05 "This notion that an illness with one set of symptoms can have different causes at different times means that people always have in mind the possibility that the first practitioner they choose to heal an illness may not be the correct one. If the cure he administers fails to get results, they will be likely to switch to another practitioner of the same type or to a practitioner of a different type entirely. The important premise [Page 102] seems to be that there are specific cures attached to specific causes."
t0019 cite0174 AD05 "From a functional point of view, various types of care do not have any interrelations. Modern psychiatrists are concerned with the mental health situation of the whole society, and they usually make an effort to maintain close relations with modern medical workers and modern counsellors. However, there is no extension of contact to the folk care system. Among folk practitioners every person performs individually and there is no organization within this system. The general attitude is one of ignorance of each other, almost of suspicion, and cooperation between practitioners is not attempted."
t0020 cite0175 AD05 "A mother-in-law with no grandchildren will not be able to restrain herself for long. Some action is called for, and it usually involves a visit to the tang ki . A tang ki is a religious practitioner who serves as an intermediary for a god. The god takes possession of the tang ki' s body and speaks through him to the suppliants. People come to the tang ki to ask his god for help in finding lost items, curing sick people and animals, changing a family's economic fortune, settling quarrels with relatives or friends, and solving the problem of infertility in [Page 150] pigs and brides. Usually the cause of a misfortune is discovered to be a ghost or a supernatural troublemaker from popular mythology who must be placated with offerings, but the tang ki 's prescription is often more commonsensical than his diagnosis. We have heard more than once of a tang ki who advised a client to consult a medical doctor, and on one sad occasion we listened to a tang ki advise an old lady to go home and prepare mourning clothes. He had “saved” her aged husband once before, but the old man had now lived far beyond his allotted years."
t0021 cite0176 RV02 "With the decline of shamanism, most Yakut rely on Western medicine administered in hospitals and clinics. Yet rumors persist of faith healing, described as spiritual or hypnotic. A few Yakut with shamanic family backgrounds attend medical school, supporting beliefs that healing talent can be inherited. Traditional healers (who had long periods of apprenticeship) were specialized, with herbal experts, bonesetters, shaman's assistants, and various grades of shamanic power. Sources vary as to whether male or female shamans were more powerful. Drumming and the music of the of the KHOMUS enhanced a shaman's trance during séances to ascertain the cause of illness. Each person was believed to have three souls, which were necessary to maintain health."
t0022 cite0177 AW42 "There are many individuals famed in some degree as physicians. Some are equivalent to the general practitioners of the West, while others are specialists who possess remedies for particular diseases. There are others who might be described as veterinary physicians. When, however, an illness persists the patient and the relatives suspect that some supernatural agency is at work, and they then call in the ojha, or magician. The ojha is not necessarily a Santal, though there are now so many Santals who are learned in ojha art that it is usually possible for a Santal to be called. They are men possessed of special powers who have gone through a period of training, followed by an initiation ceremony at the hands of an ojha, and they in turn pass on their knowledge to their own disciples. Tradition says that formerly this training was strenuous and serious. It took the form of a course that lasted from May until October, the time of the Dãsã[unavailable], which is the same as the Dasserah festival of North India and the Durga Puja in Bengal. Throughout this period the disciples had to attend at the house of the ojha every evening until finally they were initiated. At the conclusion of this ceremony the ojha used to take his disciples on a begging expedition through the surrounding villages on three successive days."
t0023 cite0178 AX04 "Today most pregnant women regularly make the seven-mile journey to Medawachchiya (66) to attend the government antenatal clinic. To add to this a government medical officer visits the village by car roughly once a week. This does not imply that the traditional ayurvedic doctors ( vedar[unknown]ala ) or the magical practitioners ( anumätir[unknown]ala ) have been driven out of business, but they are now faced with competition."
t0024 cite0056 AX04 "At present there is no hamaduruwo , ‘Buddhist monk’, resident in Rangama and, therefore, no one to officiate over certain of the ceremonies. During my 1965 stay, there were organized efforts to bring a monk to Rangama permanently, but by 1968 there was still no one willing to reside there. The villagers, particularly the upaas[unknown]k[unknown]s , continually lament the absence of clergy and put down their failure to attract a monk to the difficulty of access and the relatively poor diet, factors which should not enter into consideration but apparently do, nevertheless. There have been several Rangama residents who have entered the order, and most of them still belong to it but reside elsewhere. One village elder has derobed and resides in Rangama, however. At one time he was in charge of the Rangama temple. At present, he serves as an ayurvedic or native physician and maintains a [Page 745] polyandrous household with his younger brother. Villagers cite the brother’s wife as the cause for indecision concerning the order. The former monk is said to have entered and left the order several times. When I first arrived in Rangama I was told that the Rangama monk had ‘died’, a common way of referring to derobed monks in Ceylon. In the Rangama case, there is additional embarrassment stemming from the ex-monk’s reasons for leaving the order. I am unable to comment first hand on the reception of ex-monks elsewhere in Ceylon, but in Rangama there has been apparently no attempt to ostracize this man. For example, he was not the focus of ‘evil eye’ accusations, a common method of effecting attenuated relations, nor of accusations of sorcery, a method of severing them (MacDougall, ms.). The only index of possible past tensions is the location of the polyandrous household; the dwelling is one of the furthest afield in the village. Villagers, however, connect the location of the dwelling with efforts to distract official attention from the marriage. The ex-monk also maintains a room in the village nucleus, perhaps for this purpose. One suspects, however, that the distant location was judiciously chosen to minimize any possible conflict with others over the polyandrous union and the rejection of the sangha . One significant reason why he enjoys good relations with the rest of the villagers is that his considerable expertise is valued and even necessary. He is the most important [Page 746] and most knowledgeable ayurvedic physician. He is also familiar with the textual material on such matters as housebuilding. Furthermore, in the absence of an ordained monk, he is next best. He knows the religious rituals and often leads the chanting of pirit , ‘the scriptures’, at the temple on full moon days. On occasion, he says ban[unknown] , ‘sermons’, which are normally delivered only by ordained monks, but I never witnessed such a preaching."
t0024 cite0056 AX04 "A monk might normally officiate at the temple on full moon days, at funerals and at such rituals as the consecration of a house. Efforts to bring monks to the village for such occasions sometimes succeed. When one arrives, attempts are often made to organize a ban[unknown] preaching as well."
t0025 cite0056 AX04 "Specialists in Rangama concerned with protective or curative technologies may be subdivided into two broad categories which are related to depth and breadth of expertise: specialists who use titles derived from their specialty (major specialists) and specialists who do not use titles (minor specialists). The major specialists resident in Rangama include an astrologer, two kapuraalas , two ayurvedic physicians and a waDuraala , ‘master builder’. These individuals are assumed to have broad knowledge of the principles of an entire specialty. Minor specialists are technicians whose knowledge is considered more limited. In the case of ayurvedic medicine, for example, they are not considered specialists on the entire science and do not diagnose sarvange leD[unknown] , ‘systemic diseases’. Minor specialists in astrology do not cast horoscopes and are thought to lack the requisite knowledge. They confine themselves to tasks of a less comprehensive nature such as calculating auspicious times for beginning important activities. As for the minor specialists associated with yakk[unknown]m[unknown] , ‘demonology’, there are a couple of apprentices to the kapuraalas and a number of individuals whose expertise is limited to such matters as removing spells. Minor specialists who [Page 810] could be grouped with the waDuraala are only carpenters. Since they are not specialists in a protective or curative technology, they are not classed here with the other major and minor specialists cited above."
t0025 cite0056 AX04 "Any specialist, major or minor, engaged in diagnosing conditions and prescribing countermeasures is considered to practice a kaar[unknown]n[unknown] , lit., ‘cause’. Only major specialists whose work is referable to the ancient learned traditions are considered to know saastra s or vidyaaw[unknown] s, ‘sciences’. These latter two terms are Sanskrit borrowings and are recognized as learned words. They suggest ‘theory’ embracing an entire specialty. kaar[unknown]n[unknown] is not considered a learned word and suggests ‘practice’ or ‘practical art’. All the major specialists in Rangama are considered to be experts on an ancient learned tradition with the exception of the kapuraala s who are not associated with one. Unlike the other major specialists, the talents of a kapuraala lie not in knowing but in mediating. The analogy in function between the kapuraala who mediates between human beings and supernaturals and the magul kapuraala , ‘marriage broker’, who mediates between human beings exclusively has already been pointed out elsewhere (Yalman 1967:161)."
t0025 cite0056 AX04 "Although the prospective owner of the dwelling frequently supplies most of the labor in Rangama, dwelling construction is frequently planned and supervised by the waDuraala who has learned both construction techniques and rituals associated with construction in an apprenticeship to another master builder. Furthermore, any piece [Page 811] of construction or portion thereof which requires knowledge of special construction techniques is also executed by this man. In wattle and daub dwellings, for example, the construction of doors, door frames, windows and window frames requires specialized knowledge. The waDuraala claims to have executed this woodworking for approximately twenty Rangama dwellings. Other specialized knowledge includes stone work, cement work and brick work."
t0026 cite0056 AX04 "Some prescriptions about auspicious measurements for the dwelling are given in the appended Mayimataya , verses 43-46. Much more elaborate information is contained in the Vaastu Vidyaawa and in the Ge Biim Saastra which detail appropriate measurements for dwellings of individuals belonging to various castes and holding various offices within a feudal hierarchy. Astrological specialists concerned with dwelling construction are well-informed on these elaborate prescriptions, and a few individuals claim to have built their houses according to them. The ‘castes’ referred to, at least in the Ge Biim Saastra , are not Sinhalese castes (as is the case in many portions of the Mayimataya ) but the Indian varnas , and the feudal offices referred to do not have any contemporary relevance for the Sinhalese. Residents who have used these prescriptions claim to have done so in the following fashion: they follow the prescriptions given for the Vaisaya varna which traditionally included cultivators. Since most Rangama residents are cultivators by caste and occupation, such prescriptions are considered the appropriate ones."
t0026 cite0056 AX04 "Information on auspicious measurements can be obtained from astrological specialists, not from the waDuraala . The only restriction which the waDuraala places on the dimensions of the dwelling is that he will not take even measurements for the length and breadth of the dwelling. He considers odd numbers auspicious."
t0027 cite0056 AX04 "The traditional spheres of influences of both ayurvedic physicians and dwelling construction specialists in the little community are receiving re-definition in modern Ceylon, and standards with which the traditional specialist frequently cannot comply are being set. In Ceylon, modern medicine whether it is indigenous or Western, has been institutionalized so that there are schools, certificates and centers for the practice of medicine. The village ayurvedic physician who is not associated with the institutions of modern medicine emerges in the hierarchy as a second rung specialist. It is not simply the fact that he is associated with a traditional ‘science’ and not Western medicine that calls his authority into question. There is general confidence in ayurvedic medicine, and the Ceylon government gives official encouragement to its practice. It is rather that the village specialist either is a successful apprentice to another local practitioner, perhaps to an older, more experienced close relative, or is in some cases even self-taught. His ‘science’, on the other hand, has become institutionalized along the lines of Western medicine and has adopted some of its practices."
t0028 cite0056 AX04 "The traditional spheres of influences of both ayurvedic physicians and dwelling construction specialists in the little community are receiving re-definition in modern Ceylon, and standards with which the traditional specialist frequently cannot comply are being set.... In a similar fashion the dwelling construction specialist in the little community finds his expertise challenged by a new type of specialist who is deemed better qualified in the wider community. In recent times [Page 916] a distinction has been made between ordinary carpenters and licensed construction specialists, and only the latter are permitted to obtain contracts for the construction of government buildings. Neither the Rangama waDuraala nor any of the other carpenters resident in the village possess a license, for they are unfamiliar with many of the modern construction techniques necessary to obtain one. They have not been apprenticed to other licensed practitioners. Not unexpectedly, the ritual activities which are fundamental in the definition of traditional ‘design’ are irrelevant in obtaining a license."
t0029 cite0179 AO07 "The range of the salaries mentioned above means that vocations requiring formal training to pay [Page 246] more than unskilled jobs but not necessarily more than skilled jobs requiring training through apprenticeship.

About ninety-nine percent of the people in the village still have their delivery at home through traditional devices. The delivering doctor of the village is called mo tamyae. Mo refers to a doctor or a practitioner of a professional skill. Tamyae is, according to tradition, the name of the rishi or wise man who was the originator of the art of delivery. It is found that the mo tamyae is almost always a woman."

t0031 cite0127 AO07 "Similarly the monk's role as healer and apothecary especially, in urban areas, has to some extent been usurped by the more widespread acceptance of the methods of witthayasat (science) whose practitioners, the doctors and nurses of Ayutthaya, are more accessible to the townsfolk. The bhikkhu's function as banker and money-lender has also been taken over by professionals, whilst it is in the very nature of the greater occupational diversity and specialization of the urban situation that few monks are qualified to give advice on occupational problems."

A former medical orderly in the army, for instance, utilized his training to set up a practice. These practitioners used both traditional and modern systems. They would on rare occasions come to a Bang Chan farm house on call. They enjoyed the confidence and patronage of the most educated, progressive, and affluent element in Bang Chan's population, such as the teachers and many of the leaders, both young and old, who, in their patronage, saw themselves as less old-fashioned. Their large practice was lucrative, fees of 1000 baht for a course of injections being cited. Though consulted for maladies of pregnancy, to our knowledge they did no obstetrical work."

There were, for instance, the exorcisers of spirits or disease objects ( [unknown] ph[unavailable]), and the curers ( [unknown] raks[unavailable]) who made up decoctions particularly for element imbalances. Astrologist-foretellers ( [unknown] d[unavailable]) analysed disturbances due to astral confluences; soul-ceremonialists ( [unknown] khwan) carried on the khwan-strengthening rites; and the [unknown] san[unavailable] specialized in love and hate magic. On a lower plane were masseurs ( [unknown] n[unavailable]at) and mid-wives ( [unknown] tamy[unavailable][unavailable]). No specialist could operate in the field of another unless he had formally acquired that specialty. No limits, though, were set on the number of specialties a person might acquire so that all their lives, [unknown] were open to and seeking new knowledge by pilgrimage, discussion, or visit to a Chinese or modern druggist. The major curing specialties were only in the hands of males, but men and women both practiced the minor branches of midwifery and massaging."
t0034 cite0180 AO07 "An ill individual made a preliminary self-diagnosis to ascertain which was the pertinent specialist to consult. A quick cure occurred if the diagnosis were correct, because the specialist then had the exact curing agent and magic for that disorder. If the first [unknown] were unsuccessful, the patient moved on without embarrassment to another. In fact, a person might be a-ouring with 2 or 3 [unknown] at once, and a modern doctor besides (cf. Hauck, 1956:37):"
t0034 cite0180 AO07 "“She goes to [unknown] Suk who is good for spirits, and to [unknown] Plung at Lam Pakachet who is good for headaches and vomiting. Two years ago her child was sick with san chak and was cured by [unknown] Suk. First she took the child to Suk but a few days later went to Sawad at Lolae because she was afraid the child would die. Sawad gave tablets. She did not revisit either [unknown] because the child recovered. [unknown] Suk helped most because he had experience in magic” (SS.)."
t0034 cite0180 AO07 "For reasons of convenience, however, people also developed lasting relationships with particular [unknown], usually the nearest, or a kinsman, to whom they turned first for medical help."
t0035 cite0180 AO07 "About the seventh month, D[unavailable]an pondered who should help her at her delivery. Some of her friends were delivered by their own mothers, but Lek had undertaken the delivery of another daughter's child, and the baby had died in an hour. D[unavailable]an suspected that her mother, therefore, would prefer not to do it, and knew that she herself would feel uneasy. So she decided for safety's sake to ask a midwife. She and Song could well afford the ceremonial offering with its customary 20 or so baht, even though the midwife said it was “as you please.” A great many women never consulted with a midwife beforehand at all, but just sent word to the nearest one when the pains started or when trouble was encountered. Midwives varied in their capabilities, however, and D[unavailable]an wanted not only a good one but someone she knew well. Muslim midwives were said to be skilled, but they happened to live too far from her. D[unavailable]an decided to ask her elder aunt, S[unavailable][unavailable], who was a well known midwife. Everything was right about S[unavailable][unavailable] She had experienced hands, a true desire to help, and effective magic; and she was a relative. Best of all, her own babies had eaten and slept well, had cried little, and now were grown to maturity. With such proof of merit, capabilities, and fortunate relations with supernatural powers, what better person to help D[unavailable]an start her baby on its earthly existence? Actually, if something happened, and S[unavailable][unavailable] could not come, D[unavailable]an knew she would not be alone or unassisted. Almost every woman, and quite a few men, had [Page 43] seen childbirth not once, but many times, so willing hands abounded. So, one day, D[unavailable]an went to S[unavailable][unavailable]. “Will you help me, and come when I call you? Please do not go far at that time.” S[unavailable][unavailable] agreed, knowing in her heart she had expected to care for D[unavailable]an. No day could be calculated because the baby decided when to be born. D[unavailable]an came home very fast, for doing so would help ensure a fast delivery."
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "If difficulties developed, then a more experienced person, preferably a midwife, was needed. But many a midwife assisted at normal births. Because difficulties might arise from a deficiency of merit either in the mother or the child (one could never know which), many women preferred to have in attendance, for peace of mind, either a midwife or an experienced person to insure the presence of expert help. Sometimes they were engaged in advance, more often just sent for “as pain is increasing,” it being not always certain whether the case was normal or not...."
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "In their social role, midwives felt personal but not group solidarity. A solid bond existed between an older midwife and the particular younger one to whom he or she had given training and magic. Those related by blood or marriage sometimes worked together, and even turned over cases to each other if outside demands became pre-eminent. If in trouble on a case, midwives did not call on each other unless as close, affectionate relatives but turned rather for help from a [unknown] or to the Mïnbur[unavailable] Health Center. Yet sometimes rivalry was severe. If the family of the parturient felt that no progress was being made with one midwife, they called in another and another. Each did his utmost and then stepped down when it had to be admitted, “My magic is not enough.” The final expert who brought mother and baby through before the deposed midwives glowed inwardly with pride and skill and satisfaction that the magic of his particular teacher had proved effective. The sharpness of the competition reverberated through the words, “I pushed the other midwives down.” Community standing or “face” was not lost by an unsuccessful case because of the midwives' fundamental role as helpers only, their faith in their own experiences, and again, the conviction that the course of childbirth was merit-determined."
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "Midwives were called [unknown] tamy[unavailable][unavailable] (doctor-expert-in-occultism; pounding, as in a mortar [McF. 365] crouching, [McF. 682]). There were 4 or 6 women, both Buddhist and Muslim, and 2 or 3 Buddhist men, who had delivered 100 or so babies apiece. They ranged in age from 50 to 70. Dozens of women had delivered babies one or more times but were not accorded the title of midwife."
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "The foundation of their specialty was a greater than usual manual skill, developed over long experience. “We have only our hands,” said one woman. The more expert could handle certain mal-positions, and did not hesitate, but only with permission, to put the hand into the vagina to turn the baby or “unstop the blood.” They were better judges of the progress of labor, whether normal or slow, and of the symptoms of debility. They were more likely to keep calm in the face of extreme suffering where the parturient's relatives, over-eager in their desire to help, sometimes inflicted [Page 87] severe injury, such as bruising by excessive pressing, or even in hysteria pulling the child to pieces in their effort to get it out. 66"
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "66. To give something of the measure of their skill: if the feet of the baby appeared first, one man “straightened the legs by hand inside, held the chin carefully as the head came through,” while another said, “Do not press or reach into the vagina. Let the baby come naturally.” If an arm came first, or it were a breech presentation (“the baby is turned over”), the procedure was to “pull and press lightly,” but it was conceded that neither the mother nor child could be saved. Expulsion of the placenta was frequently difficult. “It may take 2 hours or stay in 2 days or more. Some die when it is left in, but some do not.” The technique of removal was to give a medicine, press, pull with the hands rubbed with alum for a better grip, with the woman in a crawling position. Some reached into the vagina to locate it. One woman had analyzed her practice so as to know when to expect trouble: namely, in the later pregnancies and childbirths, i.e. the sixth and seventh, say, rather than in the early ones during a woman's younger years."
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "As to mortality, one “professional” man estimated 30 deaths of babies out of 238 deliveries in 50 years. Hauck (1956) reported 90.6% live births (pp. 32–33), 7% of the babies dying in the first month, 11% within the first year (pp. 39–41). One should remember that the professionals had a greater proportion of difficult cases. One woman had delivered over 100 babies and “all lived.”"
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "The male midwives, then, were in a somewhat different category than the females. They were [unknown] who had, in addition, trained their hands for midwifery as an “extra specialty.” Midwifery seems to have been one of the few areas where skilled hands were considered of greater importance than magic. “We have no magic for delivery,” said one male midwife, knowing that nothing but merit could guarantee success. Because they had access to the incantations for element and spirit control, and could make holy water, the midwife-[unknown] could spare the parturient the necessity of getting in an outside [unknown], if such were needed. However, one part of the midwife's job the men could not do. To protect their male powers of invulnerability they were forbidden to wash the woman's clothing. A woman or a female midwife always had to do this. Men also could not provide the female “mystique” particularly related to the khwan and to growth."
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "The professional midwives, both men and women, saw themselves as individual custodians of sacred knowledge and competent in a technique. They were not only interested and ready, but obligated to give expert care to anyone, anywhere it was needed."
t0036 cite0180 AO07 "Since these 2 worlds were qualitatively different, each required a different method of learning. The supernatural world, immaterial, royal and sacred, was learned [Page 93] by instruction from a ritually 71 approached teacher. “One cannot accidentally learn. One has to ask to be taught.” As a practitioner in this field, the title “[unknown]” signalized expertise; where teaching was involved, the title was khr[unavailable] (teacher [McF. 183]) or [unavailable][unavailable]h[unavailable]n (professor [McF. 990]). Speech was the key to this tradition, in spite of sacred books and wall-carvings in the temples."
t0037 cite0181 AO07 "A variety of serious illnesses were found to occur among residents of Bang Chan. As a rule, local traditional practitioners were consulted first, but most persons reported to have been seriously ill eventually received treatment by outside practitioners with some training in modern medicine."
t0038 cite0181 AO07 "Within the community of Bang Chan, about 8 traditional “doctors” and 15 traditional midwives practiced their skills. Three of the traditional practitioners were Buddhist persists. The others earned their living chiefly by farming. In addition, two or three persons who were skilled at massage, and at least one medium had some reputation for success in treating sick persons...."
t0038 cite0181 AO07 "Illness was reported as occurring in 4 households only. In one of these, a 49-year old man reported loss of sensation over the extremities and other symptoms which led the physician in the research group to conclude that he had beriberi. As treatment, this man had used an herb recommended by a priest, a native medicine given him by a neighbor and had gone to a private clinic at Minburi where he received an injection. 1 In another family, a 39-year old man who had asthma, took an advertised remedy which he purchased from a drugstore. Two children in the third family had fever for 8 days, for which a traditional practitioner prescribed herbs. In the fourth family, a 1-year old child with eczema was taken first to a traditional practitioner, then to a private clinic in Minburi where he was given an injection...."
t0038 cite0181 AO07 "Fifteen of the 24 persons who were seriously ill had treatment by modern doctors, several patients receiving treatment from more than one. Thirteen patients had one type of treatment only (as that from either traditional practitioner or modern doctor), 7 used 2 types, 3 used 3 types, and 1 had 4 types of treatment from 5 individuals. The latter case was that of a child who was described as sick for 60 days with pneumonia, neck swelling and fever, and was treated by a traditional practitioner, two persists who were also traditional practitioners, and a medium, all in Bang Chan, and a second-class doctor in Minburi. Another child who was sick with lom sandan (faintness, weakness or loss of consciousness) for three days was treated by 4 local traditional practitioners and a second-class doctor at Minburi. One child with saang (a disease of young children, said to be caused by the loss of the soul or spirit) was treated by the modern doctor at Minburi, only...."
t0038 cite0181 AO07 "As a rule, local practitioners of one sort or another were visited or called first, those in Minburi next, and those in Bangkok, only after nearby help had been consulted. This order was not invariable however. For example, in the Hamlet KY-7 serios (Hanks, 1954) was one woman who was sick with beriberi for about 8 months after childbirth. She went first to a second-class doctor in Minburi, then to a nearby Muslim measure, then to a local traditional practitioner who gave her some jaa tom (cooked medicine). Another instance, recorded in the field notes, is that of a school teacher's baby who had abscesses on her head. The mother took her child first to Minburi, where she was given an injection and a sulfa drug to be taken orally. The child did not get well immediately, and before all of the drug had been taken, the mother took the child to a local traditional practitioner who gave her a decoction of herbs which was to be given by mouth. Thus in some cases, modern doctors were consulted first, and local traditional practitioners later, if relief was hot as speedy as was expected. The experience in this one hamlet suggested a willingness to try a variety of treatments, and the existence of a considerable degree of confidence in modern medicine...."
t0038 cite0181 AO07 "A number of references were made to history of cholera, smallpox and malaria, but these did not appear to be current threats. Two cases of severe diarrhea were called “cholera” but one was on the way to recovery the next day. The traditional practitioner who was asked to treat the other, urged that she be taken to the hospital, and himself accompanied the patient and family members."
t0039 cite0182 AO07 "Secondly, in response to fateful forewarnings, villagers seek various types of protection by magic e.g., amulets such as a Buddha head sacralized by a priest or lay magician, ritual immunity to certain diseases or mishaps, protection by guardian spirits, or protection from malevolent spirits by propitiation in spirit houses (saan praphuum). The spheres of magic and divination may actually be combined in a single practitioner. Textor has described a female shaman possessed by a male spirit, at work in a central Thai village: “… offering advice, giving or promising help, pronouncing a sacralizing phrase over a containerful of medical ingredients, making predictions…. (Textor 1962: 56)”..."
t0039 cite0182 AO07 "One particular sort of magical behavior, common in urban as in rural Thailand, is that of beginning important or potentially dangerous undertakings at an auspicious time divined by an astrologer. People who may be very casual about time in other contexts can become very meticulous about beginning some ritual or new effort precisely at the auspicious moment. This strong emphasis seems consistent with the value placed on initiating an action properly so that it will be a favorable precedent. As Hanks has observed:"
t0039 cite0182 AO07 "… the first occurrence of any phenomenon establishes a precedent which defines all subsequent occurrences of this phenomenon. This … may be compared to Newton's law of motion, ‘a body in motion continues to move …’ extended to apply to psychic and moral as well as physical events … Precedents are also set by astral confluence … parents observed, ‘Since our son was born on Saturday, he will have a lot of power … nothing will harm him.’ (Hanks 1959: 7)...."
t0039 cite0182 AO07 "Similarly, a traditional midwife explained to Hanks that she turned an expectant mother's feet away from the family spirit house and in line with, rather than against, the scales of the cosmic serpent's back (Hanks 1963: 45). Such esoteric knowledge requires informed specialists, since the cosmic serpent, for [Page 214] example, to whose direction human activity should conform, revolves completely every 24 hours (Textor 1960: 378, 423, quoted by Hanks 1963: 45)."
t0040 cite0183 AO07 "Special medicine ( jakablyad) has been bought from a Chinese herb specialist at either Kilopaed or Minburi. Black, sooty cobwebs are gathered from the walls and ceiling above the stove and are mixed into the medicine. The entire mixture is then put into a large container half filled with rice wine. The mother will drink this at various intervals throughout the day."
t0041 cite0058 AO07 "Other methods of curing include the use of herbal medicines prepared by ritual specialists plus various techniques such as spitting sacred water over a painful part of the body and then stroking the area to draw out the pain. One farmer who had learnt a variety of magical herbal medicines from his father (which is the usual way in which this knowledge is transmitted) would also cover the sole of his foot with sacred oil, stand on a red hot plough-share, and then walk over the afflicted part of the patient, usually the legs. All these specialists who are referred to as [unknown] doctor, are men. The only women [unknown] are midwives ( [unknown] tham y[unavailable]e), but there are none resident in Hua Kok."
t0041 cite0058 AO07 "Men practising curing techniques are said to have wich[unavailable], knowledge, a word which implies a special ritual or magical knowledge in place of more secular types ( khw[unavailable]m r[unavailable]). It is also used for the incantations which grant protection from gunshot wounds or which make women fall irresistably in love with one. These various types of wich[unavailable] incantation are passed on between kinsmen and close friends. Their effectiveness is to some extent dependent on the user's ritual state. It was said of the headman who had many wich[unavailable] that he would not eat tín phí, the food left over from spirit seances. [14] He had wich[unavailable] for dealing with guns, knives, women and injections. The inclusion of the latter, modern innovation on this list is interesting though in a sense incorrect. He had learnt to give injections and select medicines by reading medical manuals prepared by the main drug companies. Consequently he practised as an injection doctor without the normal ritual observance of saluting the teacher ( wai khr[unavailable]) which precedes the pronouncement of magical incantations in curing and the practice of certain other skills such as playing musical instruments."
t0042 cite0184 AO07 "The limited access to formal knowledge structures the official order of society. Those with access are entitled to positions and the respect that goes with them. This social function of knowledge, to qualify as a teacher, to be recognized as an expert or physician, or to be addressed as professor, learned man (acharya = aacaan), or doctor, is not only very visible but also highly satisfying. Such a person will be consulted as a repository of the knowledge to which people pay respect. The efficaciousness of that knowledge is often doubtful, but the man in need of help will at least sample the recipe. It is not expected that a teacher who hands down knowledge has great diagnostic insight in the matters about which he is consulted. He goes by rule or precedent, and even then more by analogy than by analysis. He is not curious about the situation and does not need to be — because he knows."
t0043 cite0185 AO07 "Traditional Thai medicine was not a single discipline but a collection of specialties: expelling spirits, setting bones, preparing medicines. Most Bang Chan practitioners of traditional medicine today know half a dozen or more specialties, learned from practitioners who were willing to share their information. One practitioner enumerated his teachers:"
t0043 cite0185 AO07 "A priest in Bangkok taught me [as a temple boy] to make medicines for children and later how to cure adults. I spent seven years with this priest. Later, when I resigned, I lived in Bang S¯y and assisted my mother's brother who was a practitioner ( m[unavailable][unavailable]). After retiring from the police, I entered the priesthood and learned from Phra Jim how to make holy water. Later an old man named N[unavailable]j Jiam, who lived in Thonbur[unavailable], asked me to live with him. I spent fifteen days there and learned to make holy water. Next Phra Phl[unavailable]j, a priest at Bang Chan who came from Petchabur[unavailable] Province, also taught about making holy water. His elder brother, Phra Plasai, also taught me how to make holy water and mix medicines. He lived in Kanchanabur[unavailable] Province but came to Bang Chan from time to time. Phra Tung lived at a Bangkok temple and taught me how to set broken bones. [LMH 6/4/53]"
t0043 cite0185 AO07 "From each teacher he learned unique formulas and subsequently paid annual ritual thanks (waj khr[unavailable]) to these teachers in order to keep the knowledge fresh. Doubtless Sin had specialties of these kinds; a man who met him from time to time described another one of these specialties: “People came from all over to get Sin to cure them. He was keen in every disease. In the case of cholera he made a spirit house and then a storm would come. If the house collapsed, the patient would recover. If there were no wind, the patient would die” (LMH 2/6/54)."
t0044 cite0186 AO07 "The love magic ritual specialist makes two statuettes. A wide variety of materials may be used in making the two statuettes: wood, hay, beeswax, the raw white cotton thread used in many rituals, and clay mixed with powdered bones of the dead. The name of the beloved girl is written on one statuette. That statuette is sacralized by invoking the girl's bodily aspects and elements, and her soul. On the second statuette, the specialist writes the name of the lover. Then the specialist juxtaposes the two statuettes [Page 13] in a face-to-face hugging embrace and recites Khaathaa. Following this ritual performance, the specialist buries the statuettes, tied together in the hugging position. The two are usually buried near the woman's home. For the best results, they should be buried in her backyard...."
t0044 cite0186 AO07 "Corpse Oil, Náam man phraaj, [unknown]. The specialist employs the corpse of someone who has died violently (called Ph˘ii taaj [unknown]), preferably that of a woman who has died in childbirth (called Ph˘ii taaj [unknown] klom, [unknown]). It is important that the corpse be relatively fresh. The specialist proceeds under the cover of darkness to a corpse store-house. He and his helper (very often the suitor) obtain a suitable corpse and place it in a sitting position, leaning it against a tree or other object. As the specialist recites the proper Khaath[unavailable]a, he applies a lighted candle just under the corpse's chin and/or at the elbows. The heat causes oils and other fluids in the corpse to drip into a receptacle. If the suitor places a single drip of this oil in the girl's food, she will become totally enslaved to him upon swallowing the food. He could, alternatively, squirt a drop of this oil on any part of her body with the same result."
t0044 cite0186 AO07 "Although this notorious corpse oil is well-known among the Thai, I have yet to meet an informant with it in his possession. It is said that the use of corpse oil is obsolete for many reasons. The reason most often [Page 15] given is that it is too mean, for although the girl will fall hysterically in love with the suitor, she will also be crazed for the rest of her life unless aided by the right magic employed by the specialist(s). Furthermore, this ritual is more difficult to perform now since most of the corpse store-houses, especially those in Bangkok and other big cities, are well built and protected. This fearsome corpse oil is frequently mentioned in Thai love literature, including contemporary novels and movies."
t0044 cite0186 AO07 "Amulets and Charms, Takrùd These are miscellaneous objects sacralized by love magic specialists in elaborate ritual processes by the use of various appropriate Khaath[unavailable]a. They are highly valued by suitors and, as a result, cost a great deal of money. The Lín S[unavailable]aríkaa amulet ([unknown]), for example, is either oblong or stick-shaped.

When an individual falls hysterically in love with a particular person, his or her relatives generally assume that he or she is the victim of love magic. They seek the services of a ritual specialist and also take the victim to the respectable monks at the temple. The person who suffered from love magic listens to Buddhist chants from the Pali and Thai texts and obtains Montra Water to drink and to be sprinkled with. In this process, the monks are regarded as Monk Doctors ([unknown] Phrá, [unknown])."
t0045 cite0186 AO07 "The secular ritual specialists employ more complicated methods. The specialists who can undo love magic are those who can also make love magic items. In undoing the love magic, the specialist might elect to treat the case by the same kind of complex homepathic magic that caused the original trouble. For example, he may make Tied Statuettes (Phùug Hùn, [unknown]), sacralizing and validating them, but then he cuts the string, thereby undoing the effectiveness of the original magic. Or the specialists may try to find the original objects that caused the love magic and destroy those objects, such as Love Dolls and Tied Statuettes mentioned above."
t0045 cite0186 AO07 "If love magic cannot be undone by any method, the victim has to be kept in the confined area of the family home. In some seriously hysterical cases, the victim of love magic is chained and watched closely. This is [Page 25] because if the victim is a woman, she may run away or elope with her man. If the victim is a young man or a husband, he might marry a woman his family does not approve of, such as a prostitute, or he could bring his mistress (usually from a lower class than he and his principal wife) into the house or bequeath family property to her. However, a married man is free to do anything he wishes, especially if he himself is the head of the family and his parents are either old or already dead. In such cases his wife will seek the advice and practice of a love magic specialist or use Coupling Philtre, or find secular ways to win his heart."

They invite a ritual specialist, who can be a Buddhist monk or an older layman, to do this. The specialist strings a white cotton thread, known as s[unavailable]ajs[unavailable]n 1 , around the place of confinement in the form of a square, several feet off the floor level. Whenever such a cord is placed around an area or an object it underlines the sacredness of that which is enclosed. The ritual specialist sacralizes a bowl of water, by reciting from memory sacred verses in the P[unavailable]li language whilst holding a lighted candle above the surface of the water in the bowl. During this recitation, the specialist holds the candle at such an angle that it drips was on to the surface of the water. After sacralization, the water is known as ‘ mantra-water’, or námmon. Immediately after námmon has been prepared, it can be sprinkled in and around the area of confinement. The householder may keep some of the námmon to extinguish the fire that traditionally formed an essential part of the post-natal treatment."

Khw[unavailable]n is difficult to translate into English, it may mean ‘ego’, ‘soul’, ‘morale’, ‘grace’, or ‘prosperity’. In order to increase the courage and reassure the sould of the infant, it is dressed with glittering ornaments and the whole family, forming a circle around the child, wafts smoke from three lit candles towards the centre. During the ritual, the specialist binds a piece of cotton string around the wrist of the baby, anoints the child's forehead and implores the soul of the child to be unwavering, to stay firm, and to enjoy its pleasant surroundings."
t0047 cite0060 AO07 "When a young man has decided upon a certain 'aacaan sàg, he must approach this ritual specialist with proper deference in order to make an appointment for the first session of tattooing. Often the 'aacaan sàg will decide that a Tuesday or a Saturday is the most appropriate because reputedly on such days of the week the ‘spirits are strong’. On the appointed day, the young man must come to the house of the tattooer, carrying a candle, some flowers and the fee. Payment for these types of magical services should traditionally be connected with the number six. Older people remember the days when they used to pay six [unknown], which is equivalent to 1 ½ baht, but nowadays the fee is often six baht or a plural number of six baht. The young boy should kneel down with his face towards the east, light the candle and incense and offer them together with the flowers to the ‘teachers’, those who in the dim past handed down the knowledge of tattooing. This ceremony is called wâajkhruu, and is also [Page 86] performed by the 'aacaan sàg. It is a common ritual also among Thai actors, dancers, musicians and boxers."
t0048 cite0187 AO07 "The standard belief is that when a woman gives birth to a still-born perfect non-decaying miniature baby, she and her husband keep the matter a secret. Above all, they take pains lest the news become known among doctors, for a doctor would then covet the Still-Born Ghost inside the little corpse, and “call” the ghost out of the corpse. The doctor does this because he wants this valuable ghost to come and live with him, be nurtured (líang) by him, remain under his control, and help him earn money by serving clients in a variety of ways. If the baby's corpse begins to decay, this would be considered prima facie evidence that a doctor (or other skilled person) had learned about it, and, using a khaathaa, had “called” the ghost out of the corpse."
t0048 cite0187 AO07 "It sometimes happens that a doctor will somehow or other obtain, not only the Still-Born Ghost, but also the corpse in which it is embodied. As a mark of respect, the doctor will always keep the diminutive corpse in a suitable receptacle — probably air-tight and animal-proof — and place this receptacle on a high shelf. Visitors are sometimes permitted to inspect the corpse. Thus, in one nearby wat, Monk Doctor Ernest, a relatively acculturated, highly educated former school teacher, owns such a corpse, which [Page 352] he keeps in a glass case. At another wat farther away, one of the monks owns the corpse of a Chinese infant said to have been still-born. The owner claims that he “found” it one day, and noted its remarkable undecomposed condition. [It is possible, of course, surreptitiously to embalm such a corpse, for embalming fluids are available in Bangkok.] Villagers have gone to that wat to see the corpse and consult the monk doctor. The visitor desiring a prediction on a problem can, if he wishes, obtain from the doctor a containerful of numbered divinatory sticks (sˇan tîw). 21.4 In the presence of the corpse, he shakes these sticks until one drops out of the container — bearing the number of a printed prediction slip which the visitor then obtains from the doctor. The supernatural power or influence (ìdthìríd) from the Still-Born Ghost is believed to have been transferred to, or invested in, the numbered sticks — rendering the resulting prediction especially accurate (mâen)."
t0049 cite0187 AO07 "Changes in health, hygiene, and sanitation were also dramatic. The use of soap for personal hygiene, and detergents for laundering, increased from close to zero in the early Fifties to almost 100 percent in 1970. Water-seal privies, rare in 1957, became commonplace. While epidemic diseases had already been brought under control by 1957, much further progress was made in reducing the [Page 692] incidence of various communicable diseases. On the curative side, by 1957 the antibiotic revolution was well under way; it continued apace. During the Sixties the government opened a health station in Bang Chan itself, staffed by a resident modern midwife. Inexorably, more and more of the villagers began to favor this midwife, or various modern practitioners and facilities in Minburi or Bangkok — to the virtual demise of local “traditional” doctors and midwives. Infant mortality rates dropped, as did, incidentally, the percentage of Bang Chan mothers who practiced “lying near the fire” (jùu faj) after parturition. In 1957 birth control pills were not yet available, nor was much birth control practiced by males. By 1970, an estimated ten to twenty percent of the husbands had had vasectomies, and probably at least half of the wives had used oral contraceptive pills at one time or another."
t0050 cite0062 OG11 "People quickly proceed to call a medical practitioner if /169/ it has become apparent that their own home remedies have not been of any benefit. In many cases it is a priestess who is invited to come to look at the sick person (X, 26). But people do not proceed to do it too quickly, because more expense is connected with it. Sometimes one has a priestess come for a sick child in order to napapaoepi koemoe or napapapoe’a woekotoe it. The first means “to let sit on the blanket.” For this the child stands in front of the priestess, who touches various parts of the sick body with a foeja /beaten tree bark/ blanket. Finally she puts the blanket on the child’s head and then moves it up and down seven times. In front of the sick one lies a chopping knife wrapped in a rain mat, an object that is called êmpehi and is used on other occasions. Now the priestess taps against the knees seven times, after which the child goes to sit on the êmpehi . She then declares: Mapoe’a woekotoenja , “his knees have been broken” (i.e., I have broken his knees). This is done both with boys and with girls."
t0050 cite0062 OG11 "Besides the priestess, in each village there are several men and women about whom it is known that for certain indispositions they are familiar with a remedy that has already been applied with success many times. Such a person is then asked to come to try his skill on the sick person. If his remedy appears to have no effect, then people try another medical practitioner. Friendly acquaintances and relatives often voluntarily offer to administer to the sick person a remedy that they have become acquainted with through a dream or through one fortuitous circumstance or another."
t0050 cite0062 OG11 "If such a medical practitioner has acquired a reputation, then he is called sando . Inviting a sando is simpler than getting a priestess. It may happen that the one called does not wish to come because he has something against one of the members of the family to which he is called. The mutual relationship of the villagers is often not of a friendly nature, because people are quick to step on one another’s toes. Custom prescribes that, in case of a refusal, a duit, a piece of foeja, and a chicken (or a piece of cotton) be taken to the unwilling medical-expert. These three things bear the name of aoe tatogo , “the three.” In other circumstances, too, an unwilling person is persuaded by “the three” to perform one service or another, for example, to bear witness in a lawsuit. After the offering of “the three,” one will no longer refuse to accept the invitation, even though it is done with aversion, because otherwise public opinion would be turned against him. The person making the request is then also justified in fining the one who refuses, because he is considered “guilty.” Payment is made for all the medicines furnished, because without payment they would be powerless. This price for medicines furnished is called ojoti mpakoeli , “for the ceasing, telling to stop ( maojoti ) the treatment.”"
t0051 cite0062 OG11 "The Toradja also knows from experience that the use of palm wine makes wounds smart. They have had the same experience with the use of pork. “Pork is sharp,” says the Toradja; for that reason it is prohibited during sickness. It is strange that for the same reason no foods that are mixed with anything from the coconut may be eaten: from the coconut, oil is prepared; this reminds one of pork fat; therefore both must be equally harmful. A sick person has to abstain from Spanish pepper, for this is hot and, in his opinion, makes the blood warm, i.e., unhealthy."
t0051 cite0062 OG11 "Someone who has a skin ailment does not eat chicken, fish, or maize. Not the first, because the feet of a chicken are scaly; and fish too. These scales are strongly reminiscent of the scales that come off the skin, for example, in connection with ichthyosis (scale sickness). He abstains from maize because it has skins that come loose when the kernels are pounded and which are also reminiscent of skin scales...."
t0051 cite0062 OG11 "In contrast to this a number of foods are never forbidden for a sick person by a native medical expert. Among these there is in the first place rice; among the vegetables, mustard, nambo ( Sinapis alba ), for montambo means “to leave in the lurch, to forsake”; the sickness will leave the patient. And tambata jopo , a kind of mushroom, is never forbidden for sick persons."
t0052 cite0062 OG11 "The reasons why children are born dead or die soon after birth are for the Toradja the same as those causing a difficult birth: quarreling, mistakes made at the solemnization of the marriage, and the like. The reason may also lie in the fact that husband or wife has a birthmark ( ila ) on the genitals, or that the woman has something wrong ( patoela , “mark”) in her body. In the former case, if husband or wife lets the spouse see the birthmark this is sufficient to life its disastrous effect. In the latter case, a person expert in these things ( sando ) must cut or whisk the “wrong” from the body (XI, 11)."
t0052 cite0062 OG11 "373 In order to find out whether during the next confinement the woman will again bring into the world a child incapable of living, there is divining: an expert throws medicine at the woman’s head without her noticing it; if he succeeds in touching her crown, the next child will remain alive. Or the resin of a torch is mixed with herbs and lighted. Then the torch is addressed: “If you see that the child will remain alive, then continue to burn if I cover you; if you see that it will die quickly or be born dead, then go out.” After that a cooking pot is set above the resin for some time."
t0053 cite0188 OC06 "The Iban are highly egalitarian people and every bilek family shares a strong regard for its independence and the personal reputation of its members. Nevertheless, those who distinguish themselves or enjoy outstanding material success, and their descendants, are accorded considerable respect by other persons. The Iban take pride in their family ancestry and their connections with renowned leaders and pioneers of past generations. Extensive genealogical histories ( tusut ) are preserved and orally transmitted by expert genealogists ( tukang tusut ) and by means of these histories, ancestory may be traced, in some instances, over as many as thirty generations. In addition to the status of ordinary individuals and those of outstanding achievement, the Iban also recognised two categories of hereditary servitude in the past. At the end of the present chapter, I mention these and describe the legal and ceremonial means by which war captives ( ulun ) and debt-slaves ( jaum ) were formerly freed by the mutual agreement of the slave and his or her master."
t0054 cite0189 OC06 "When the recitation is over, the representatives who speak from the bride's and bridegroom's sides will ask a person who is expert in genealogy to set forth the pedigree for the information of the people regarding the relationship between the bride and bridegroom. This will facilitate the discussion on appropriate customs in case they may cause disaster."

t0054 cite0189 OC06 "After finishing the drink (literally, “sharpening water”), the appointed genealogist holds nipah leaves (for rolling tobacco in) with which he sets forth the pedigree. He starts his pedigree by taking Sengalang Burong as the basis because from there he will be able to relate the marriage customs originating from the marriage of Sengalang Burong's son, Aji, whose chivalry is beyond the moon, Suka Raja Rengayan, who was married to Endu Anggu Kaul Ketapu, Endu Kuku Anyam Saribu, the daughter of Simpulang Gana and Endu Endun Serentum Tanah Tumboh, lying exposed to the sunshine at the middle of the country, Endu Iyak Cherindak Tanggui Buloh, hovering over the neighbouring farms. Starting from there, he will also relate the first time Raja Simpulang Gana demanded Sengalang Burong to give him a dowry of a fowl of the size of a sparrow which had spurs coiled onto its knees, a pig as big as a rat that had tusks coiled onto the tuft of bristles on the head of that certain pig, and a black jar with a sprout together with a gong."
t0054 cite0189 OC06 "In addition, he also recites the customs regarding marriage in defiance of the generation taboo which is disastrous, following Sengalang Burong's advice which he gave to his grandson, Sera Gunting who committed incest with his mother's sister, Endu Dara Chempaka Tempurong Alang alias Dayang Patri Langit. After he has related those customs, he then begins to set forth his pedigree further and gives information regarding his forefathers' expensive dowries as they were rich and chivalrous. On reaching the generation of the bride and bridegroom, he then discloses their relationship. The people will discuss the appropriate customs to remedy the marriage which might happen to be in defiance of the generation [Page 35] taboo, after the genealogist has set forth his pedigree up to that stage. If their relationship is calculated from their parents, and is in the ratio of one to two (which means that he is married to his auntie or niece), then the water is being partitioned for them, and two pigs will be slaughtered: one is to be killed in the water while the other will be butchered on land. They are requested to bathe themselves with the water that has been saturated with the blood of the pigs. The pigs to be slaughtered must be the ones that have had litters, and the jar that the bridegroom produces must be equivalent to the monetary value of nine dollars while the bride pays seven dollars. (Other customs are obtainable from a book entitled “Sengalang Burong”.)"
t0055 cite0190 OC06 "Without venturing to comment on the kinship significance of tusut , it should be noted that an Iban may record his ancestry back through both male and female forbears, as he sees fit. There is no limit to the number of tusut lines any individual may trace back from himself, except his own capacity for genealogical detail. At the lower or more recent end of the tusut , one who is a skilled genealogist ( tukang tusut ) will be informed on the exact nature of relationship to relatives at least as distant as third or fourth cousins. Iban society, tusut are essential to the solution of many questions, from determining whether a marriage is incestuous to settling a fruit-tree dispute. The parents of a marriageable daughter may be able to claim a higher bride price if they can document the existence of famous forbears -- pioneers, warleaders or politicians. A host will not be certain of how to treat his guest until he is aware of kin relationship, or lack thereof."
t0055 cite0190 OC06 "The complete flexibility with which a knowledgeable Iban may select from innumerable lines of ancestors those whom he wishes to include in any given tusut recitation, makes for a system which may be manipulated as circumstances require. Writing a century ago, the second Brooke Rajah described how two recently hostile groups of Ibans set about to reinforce a government-sponsored peace-making ceremony:..."
t0056 cite0190 OC06 "The first leader to settle in the Skrang river was Lau Moa, 21 whose name means ‘withered face’. He is a mysterious figure, best known for his children. His daughter, Lantong, was the mother of Tindin, the famous leader of migration into the Paku (see below). But he also had six sons, who were famous bards."
t0056 cite0190 OC06 "They became skilled as bards because their father, Lau Moa, had once given a gawai burong (bird festival) to which, in accordance with Iban custom, he invited the ancestors and Gods from the spirit world, including Sengalang Burong. But Sengalang Burong was very critical of the pengap or song, which Lau Moa sang to summon the guests from the spirit world. To set matters right, he sent his own bard, Sampang Gading, to teach Lau Moa's sons how to sing the pengap properly. The first son to learn from Sampang Gading was Sumbang, and he later taught his five brothers. All six of them became very skilled at this important kind of singing."
t0057 cite0191 OC06 "No doubt tensions and antagonisms do exist between Iban men and women, just as in any society. To see this, however, as evidence for a collective envy of men, on the part of Iban women, is perhaps to go a little too far (Freeman 1968:388). Contemporary Iban describe the sexual banter at headhunting festivals as “play” ( main-main ), and men themselves willingly participate n the role reversal farce, collecting firewood and forest vegetables, which they then cook, in imitation of the domestic duties of Iban women. Furthermore, one finds that many Iban women express little interest in the status-seeking self-aggrandizement of their menfolk, preferring instead to concentrate on achieving recognition in their own domain as expert weavers and ritual specialists in the art of dyeing cloth (Gavin; private communication). The latter attitude can, of course, be interpreted as symptomatic of a suppressed rivalry between men and women, where by thwarted women reject a dominant male ideology and replace it with a value system of their own."
t0058 cite0191 OC06 "In Iban society, the spear ( sangkoh ) is identified with headhunting and warfare, while the weaving heddle ( letan ) stands for their female counterpart - the design and manufacture of woven fabrics ( pua' ). This equation of male headhunting on the one hand, with female weaving, on the other, is found throughout Iban culture. Thus in Iban oral literature, the headhunting heroes of Panggau Libau, marry the women weavers of Gellong, while in real life, women who are skilled in weaving are identified with men who have been on the warpath and who have taken heads. In particular, those women who are experienced in the ritual preparation of mordants used in the dyeing of cloth ( indu' tau' nakar, tau' ngar ) are said to be the female equivalent of great war-leaders ( orang tau' serang ). And just as young men were traditionally not considered eligible for marriage until they had taken their first head, or at least been on the war-path (Leach 1950:70), neither could Iban maidens be properly considered for marriage until they had demonstrated their accomplishments at weaving pua' ’ (Howell 1912:64)."
t0059 cite0192 OC06 "When a new settlement is founded, the forest in its immediate vicinity is felled first, and as long as farms lie within a radius of about half a mile to a mile (or slightly further, if they can be reached by canoe), activities are conducted from the main long-house. After a few years however, as more distant land is brought into cultivation, accessibility becomes a problem, and when this stage is reached the community breaks up into a number of distinct groups--each group farming in a different part of the long-house territory. Typically, the whole community moves to the same general quarter of the territory, where each group takes over the pioneering of a small (i.e. unnavigable) tributary stream. These arrangements are decided upon at a series of conferences ( baum ) in which all the bilek families of the community participate. A proposal to farm new land is first mooted by several closely related bilek families (i.e. containing siblings, first or second cousins), and usually such a group will have a leader who, although he is never formally appointed, plays a major part in the inauguration and planning of the venture. Ideally he is a man skilled in the taking of auguries. Other families develop parallel plans, and gradually several groups are formed. In size these groups vary from two to ten or more different bilek families, depending largely on the extent of the area in which they propose to farm."
t0060 cite0193 OC06 "The pelian chants examined here depict the manang as one whose special expertise is in promoting beneficial interactions and separations between various natural and supernatural elements of the cosmos. The invocations acknowledge the benevolent intercession of the petara in the life of human beings and call forth the celestial manang for assistance in healing rites, but against this background the terrestrial manang is portrayed as essentially an actor, rather than a medium. As practitioners who draw on the repertoire of categorical distinctions made by the Iban, quintessentially those concerning matter and spirit, the manang are depicted intentionally moving themselves and other creatures across this dichotomy. Thus the pursuit of errant souls images, in terms of the immediate natural environment, the manangs unseen actions in retrieving lost souls and dealing with spirit adversaries. The sacrifice of a fowl exploits the cultural categorization of living things, as a borderline creature is incorporated into the human sphere, then dispatched, in order to satisfy the antu without loss of ‘real’ life. Finally, the pelian bejereki involves the construction of barriers, the bridging of realms, and the physical representation of the intangible."
t0060 cite0193 OC06 "In this chapter, I explore the activities of the manang in Iban ritual. By way of introduction, I note the range of Iban healing practices and mention some aspects of manang performances, after which I comment on the manang 's role in the neutralization of inauspicious omens and dreams. I then examine the tasks a manang undertakes in pelian rites, delineating the cultural logic which ascribes efficacy to his or her actions. Following this, I consider the content and meaning of saut rites. Finally, I conclude this chapter with an examination of the initiation rites ( bebangun ), which are thought to confer on the manang the special skills attributed to them."
t0060 cite0193 OC06 "When an Iban was ill, traditionally the first thing the family would do in their endeavour to effect a cure was celebrate a bedara mata or bedara mansau ceremony. Richards defines bedara as ‘make offering and sacrifice to accompany prayer ( pedara )’ and says mata means ‘raw, uncooked, unripe’ while mansau means ‘ripe, cooked’ (1981:32, 208-209). At bedara , as Sandin puts it, ‘offerings are made to the deities and the spirits of past manangs , so that they will come to treat the sick person with miracles and spiritual charms’ (1980:43). Masing, who considers bedara the least complex of all Iban rituals (1981:34), describes it as a rite in which ‘a person of standing in a community’ prepares an offering ( piring ) (1981:35) or sacrifices a four-footed animal ‘to secure a human life’ (1981:36). Thus, at bedara ceremonies, the Iban make offerings in order to oblige reciprocal spirit assistance, and perform sacrifices which provide substitute ‘lives’ to satisfy malevolent spirits."
t0060 cite0193 OC06 "If the bedara was not successful, the family would then call a manang to perform a pelian ceremony. The manang 's first task is diagnostic: he/she endeavours to determine the nature of the complaint, the cause of the illness and any involvement of spirits. To do so, it is essential to ascertain the condition and the whereabouts of the patient's semengat . Having made a diagnosis, the manang decides on appropriate remedial action (Jensen 1974:146-147). Sandin lists the Iban names of numerous pelian ceremonies which might be performed (1980:43, 1983:250). In each, he says, ‘the manang invites [the celestial] Menjaya Raja Manang and the souls of great manangs of the past to come to assist him with charms and miraculous healing’ (1980:43). At the conclusion of the rite, the manangs may seek to divine its success by examining a flower bud of the areca palm (Sandin 1978:78-79 n.6) or by observing whether a roughly carved wooden figure ( pentik ), stuck into the ground at the foot of the longhouse ladder, remains upright or inclines to either side by the morning following the rite (Perham 1887:97-98)."
t0060 cite0193 OC06 "Perham reports that the manang ‘never performs in daylight unless the case is very bad’, for to do so is considered ‘difficult and dangerous work’ (1887:89-90). Sandin says most pelian are held at night, beginning after the evening meal is finished (1978:58). This timing accords with the notion that reversals characterize the land of the dead ( Sebayan ), so that when it is daytime in the world of the living, it is night in the land of the dead and vice versa (Uchibori 1978:236). Thus, the shaman, who ventures into the realm of spirits to overtake a soul on the way to Sebayan , considers it safer to do so when it is light in that place. Jensen extends this idea of reversals to account for blindness or poor sight as an asset for a manang . As he puts it, ‘the physical handicap of blindness ... becomes an asset in dealings with the spirit world, indeed enables the manang to see the spirits where others cannot’ (1974:145)."
t0060 cite0193 OC06 "The manang is equipped with a medicine basket or box ( lupong ) in which he/she keeps a variety of objects ‘including pieces of tusk, wood, root, stone, crystal and glass’ (Jensen 1974:146). These items include medicinal charms and possibly [Page 50] ingredients for herbal medicines. According to Brooke Low, some manang would add to their medicine box ‘European medicines procured from the Government dispensary, for they are wide awake and ready at all times to avail themselves of remedies of known efficacy’ (Ling Roth 1896:I,266-267). However, while the manang may practise herbal medicine, they do not do so qua manang and herbal remedies are not part of shamanic rites as such (Freeman, personal communication, 15 December 1982). Nor are medicinal charms the exclusive prerogative of the manang as any Iban may possess such charms, the whereabouts of which are usually revealed in a dream by benevolent spirits. ..."
t0060 cite0193 OC06 "Should the pelian rituals fail to cure the sick person, the family may then hold a gawai sakit (ritual festival for the sick) at which a group of bards ( lemambang ) recite the pengap invocatory chant (Sandin 1980:43). As described by Perham (1882:136) and Richards (1981:326), the bards' invocation is combined with the manang 's performance of saut rites, the [Page 51] ‘[f]ullest rites for the sick performed by MANANG when PELIAN rites have failed’ (Richards 1981:326). ..."
t0060 cite0193 OC06 "If divination indicates that no cure has been effected by this ritual festival, then, in a form of the practice termed nampok , the sick person might be left alone with offerings at a solitary place thought to be inhabited by spirits. Recognizing ‘that his illness is beyond human cure’ (Sandin 1980:43), he hopes the spirits of the place will come to his aid. Finally, ‘[i]f he cannot be cured, he awaits death’ (Sandin 1980:43)."
t0061 cite0194 OC06 "A girl learns to weave from her mother or grandmother. The secret of the designs are kept within the family. A skilled weaver may work in complete secrecy, hiding her work until it is completely finished. Each woman has her own exclusive repertoire that may include as many as a hundred different designs. A woman may sell her designs at a price, but in so doing forfeits her copyright (Gill 1968:153). Originality in design is a criterion of excellence and every woman seeks to develop new patterns. For example, Mene in the Timang Gawai Amat is praised for the uniqueness of the waistband she weaves for Lang, the god of war (Masing 1981:355)."
t0061 cite0194 OC06 "Women weave not only to provide their menfolk with ceremonial jackets and waistbands, but also for their bilik family. The Iban family requires woven textiles for a number or ritual purposes, including various agricultural festivals, the Feast of the Whetstones, and festivals for warfare and the dead (Gittinger 1979:217; Sandin 1976:46). Large woven blankets ( pua ) are placed underneath offerings or used to delineate and protect a ritual area, to screen a corpse on the veranda, or to cover a newborn child on its first ritual meeting with its grandmother (Sandin 1976). Perhaps the most significant use of the pua in the context of this discussion is in the rituals attached to the headhunting cult, when a woman skilled in weaving receives the trophy head, the symbol of bravery, tanda berani , on a specially woven cloth ( pua kumbu muau [Sather 1977:xv])."
t0061 cite0194 OC06 "Woven textiles have mystical qualities. The Iban use them as protection from evil spirits and physical enemies and as a means of communication with the spirit world: a shaman requires a bidang or woven skirt as a fee for transporting a soul to the world beyond and to ensure a safe return from the underworld (Howell 1911:7). The Timang Gawai Amat contains several references to the jacket of Lang, dexterously woven (Masing 1981:283) in a superb pattern with a frog motif (1981:283). This jacket will make Lang invincible (1981:178, 145). The spiritual qualities of woven textiles is also illustrated by a myth in which one of [Page 246] Lang's daughters marries a mortal and weaves him and their son “jackets of birds” to enable them to fly and join her in heaven (Howell 1909:186-187)."
t0061 cite0194 OC06 "The Iban believe that designs have a certain ritual power and may harm a woman who tries to weave them. To protect herself, a woman may use special charms and make an offering of betel nuts and eggs to Kumang before beginning to weave (Masing 1981:436). An apprentice weaver is particularly vulnerable and must rely on the assistance of an older woman to tie the dangerous part of the textiles (Vogelsanger 1980:117). A woman's repertoire of designs may be limited by ritual prescriptions, which only the spirits can lift. When Nangku anak Dingat was almost fifty years old, for example, Kumang told her that she could weave any design she wanted ( nadai pemali ). This initiated her career as a master weaver. Her pua were much sought in her longhouse and she wore a porcupine quill adorned with several warp threads in her hair (Edric Ong 1986:26)."
t0061 cite0194 OC06 "Dyeing cotton thread is also a difficult ritual process, which perhaps only one out of fifty women master. Restrictions similar to those enforced during childbirth are imposed, and the process is said to take place covertly, away from the gaze of men. 9 Dyeing has been described as kayau indu , “the warfare of women.” A woman who is skilled in dyeing is called indu gaar or indu takar , a status similar to that of a war chief ( tau serang ) (Sather 1977a:xv)."
t0061 cite0194 OC06 "Unfortunately, not enough is known about the functioning and order of women's status differentiation in weaving. A skilled woman is paid handsomely for her services to other women who require dyed thread (Haddon and Start 1982:22). Through success in weaving, women achieve recognition of their maturity, some specific ritual honors in gawai festivals, such as receiving a skull or decorating the kelingkang pole (Sather 1977a:xv), and the distinction of having tattoos on their fingers (Komanyi 1972:102). It is also said that a husband can earn recognition and honor in certain rituals though his wife's status as a weaver."
t0061 cite0194 OC06 "In traditional Iban society, then, women are not subordinated by a male value system that emphasizes prestige in warfare. This is because they have the power to manipulate their position in relationship to the male system through their facility to endorse, challenge, or represent alternative values. It is in their interest to recreate the male value system through the indoctrination of male infants and boys, because trophy heads mean abundant rice harvests. Women are able to shift their position in relation to the male prestige system because their gender identity is located outside the system in their knowledge of weaving. As weavers, women play a vital part in protecting the life, health and fertility of the community, objectives shared by men as warriors."
t0061 cite0194 OC06 "The idiom of weaving articulates the cultural construct of femaleness in Iban society, in opposition to warfare and maleness. This is conveyed in myth, ritual, and oral literature through imagery of fertility, life, love, and sexuality, which are alternative ideals to bravery and warfare but still in the interests of the goals of the community. Knowledge of weaving and dyeing is held exclusively by mother and daughter. Each design is the original work of one woman, inspired by the spirits. Through their relationship with the spirit world, the [Page 248] textiles women weave mediate between heaven and earth. If a woman successfully establishes a relationship with the spirit world, she will be able to weave designs that will earn her adult status and, moreover, recognition as an expert weaver."
t0062 cite0195 OC06 "In former times, however, if a blood relationship could be proved among the Ibans, it sometimes helped to maintain and [Page 40] justify peaceful relations between two groups. The documents used to prove relationship were oral genealogies ( tusut ), memorized by recognized experts ( tukang tusut ). From a political point of view, the most interesting thing about an Iban genealogy is that it could be traced back through any of innumerable lines of ancestors to establish a desired relationship. At ten generations back in time, even two people from rather widely separate areas were likely to have quite a number of common forbears. If the genealogist was skilled and determined enough, he could find them."
t0063 cite0196 OC06 "Whatever the reasons may have been, the Iban neither raised nor supported permanent leaders. With the Iban oriented to independence and the achievement of the individual, to the autonomy of the bilik -family, and to a year-to-year subsistence based upon shifting cultivation of rice with little if any surplus, there was no place for non-contributing leaders. Leaders who were recognized were of an ad hoc nature, such as the war leader ( tuai serang ), who secured his position through bravery in battle; the house elder ( tuai rumah ), who adjudicated disputes and helped co-ordinate community activities; the genealogist ( orang tau tusut ), consulted when marriages were arranged; the bard ( lemambang ), who was invited to chant and magically ensure the efficacy of various ritual occasions; the augur ( tuai burong ), skilled in reading bird flights and other signs to predict the unpredictable outcome of farming, raids, and trips; and the shaman ( manang ), the medium-healer of psychic and physical illnesses."
t0064 cite0197 OA19 "The religion has certainly operated to discourage scientific investigation and the progress of arts and technology. For example: the Ifugao’s medical knowledge is little more than nil and lies principally in the setting of broken bones and the reduction of dislocations. The art descends from ancestor to son or, in some cases, daughter. Some of the bone-setters do a fairly good job of opposing the ends of fractures. I was once talking to a young practitioner, a bright enough fellow by natural endowment, but a conservative in the art. He belittled the art of bone manipulation: “The prayer is the important thing,” he said, “the prayer and the sacrifice. If these be right, the recovery will be right.”"
t0065 cite0198 OA19 "For the Ifugaos, a knowledge of pedigrees is of paramount importance. Tribal priests ( mombaki) pass on the knowledge of a clan’s genealogy ( tupon) from one generation to the next. Indeed, some priests-experts are able to provide genealogies for ten or eleven generations which include descendants in both lines of certain important ancestors. Thus, at an early age, children are taught the family genealogy, which may include relatives to the tenth degree on both the father’s and the mother’s sides. A functional knowledge of one’s lineage easily determines whom to invite for religious feasts and other gatherings which require the presence of relatives."
t0065 cite0198 OA19 "During the prestige feast ( baya; bumaya) the most knowledgeable of the clan’s genealogists identifies the people to be invited. The hosts’ representatives ( munila) go from one village to another beating their gongs and at the same time extending the invitation to the relatives—familiar and unfamiliar. The knowledge of the clan’s lineage, however, is commonly applied when a member needs assistance. When a person dies, all his relatives are expected to attend the vigil while the closest kin contribute money, pigs, or carabaos for the sacrifices ( honga). Most of all, the knowledge of the tupon strengthens the unity and mutual defense among the members. Many conflicts are avoided and others are solved when the concerned parties realize that they are of the same family origin."
t0066 cite0199 ES10 "If there were an impression at an earlier time that doctors tended to vegetate in the Highlands and fail to keep up to date, it has now been dispelled because they have chance to engage in study leave and the relation with the specialists is now so close-knit. The observer of the wide Highland situation cannot help comparing the progress of this happy, vigorous, well-integrated Service with the tempo of what should be an equally important and health-supporting rehabilitative service, that of agricultural advice and education, mentioned below. The weakest link in the Highlands and Islands Medical Service is hospitalization, in that it is inadequate except at headquarters, and conditions for the nursing-staff in some of the smaller hospitals are unsatisfactory. This situation, unfortunately, is common elsewhere in the country."

t0069 cite0202 EP04 "Privately- or officially-administered abortion is an event in many women's lives. In recent years, a woman less than twelve weeks' pregnant may apply for an abortion under the Norwegian medical plan. If, after paperwork and interviews, the abortion is granted, the operation itself is carried out in a regional hospital. This entails a trip to Hammerfest or Troms[unknown] and four days' absence from home, a telltale period."
t0069 cite0202 EP04 "Some women prefer the risks of a folk medicinal abortion. If the procedure involves the assistance of a person besides the woman herself, it is likely to be a coastal practitioner older than herself or a woman [Page 169] of her own age and inland district. The former alternative has always been more accessible to the mobile reindeer-keeping population."
t0069 cite0202 EP04 "Nowadays, most privately-administered abortions involve no help from others aside from confidential suggestions for a source of mercury. The pregnant woman may then consume a pea-sized mass of quicksilver, though not always with the desired effect. Quicksilver is also swallowed as a cure for general aches and pains. Another aborting technique, never witnessed, is the insertion of instruments such as knitting needles into the womb. If unsuccessful, the fetus could reportedly continue development but be born blind or otherwise handicapped."
t0069 cite0202 EP04 "In almost every sii'da and neighborhood there are individuals known for their healing powers, blood-stopping, and prophecy. These persons do not administer abortions, which are -- despite everything -- openly disapproved by most, but they may be called on to control hemmorages. These local healers tend to be reindeer-keeping males and sedentary females, but few of either category attract patients from any distance."
t0069 cite0202 EP04 "Due to great inhibitions surrounding nakedness, it is difficult for a pregnant woman to approach either the local doctor or one of the practitioners. There are recurring instances of women and girls giving birth without having ever confided their condition to anyone other than a sister or female cousin -- or to anyone at all."
t0070 cite0203 EP04 "The benefits of cooperation, however, were not all one-way. When Pava-Lasse merged with Heika Gubben and the rest of the native Jokkmokk herders of the Viri Group dissolved, Pava-Lasse's use of the Tarreluoppal camp site decreased, and it became more common for him to spend all spring, summer and autumn in Stalo. Pava-Lasse no longer had access to as much labor for any bare-ground independence from the Karesuando herders. With growing extensivity, grazing utilization being confined for such a long time to one general area (Virihaure), and the presence of birch forest and good fishing, it became all the more practical to erect a permanent dwelling at Stalo, a turf k[unknown] ata , better able to give shelter in the harsh climate. Although turf k[unknown] atas were not unheard of by the Jokkmokk Saamis, few mountain Saamis had any experience with them. It was indeed the northern Saamis who, with their expertise in this construction form, helped the Jokkmokk Saamis to adapt to changing conditions. Heika Gubben helped Pava-Lasse build a turf k[unknown] ata by Lake Virihaure."
t0071 cite0204 EF06 "Ritual Intervention in Folk Healing Village vernacular contains abundant folk sayings characterizing women as talkers, gossips, meddlers, busy-bodies. Women’s skills with words are thought to enhance ritual interaction with chthonic forces from the dangerous netherworld. bearers of ill winds, of disorder and chaos. A folk classification of a set of illnesses is still known as devet vetrovi, the nine winds. A bajalica who cures with words mediates via her basme (oral charms) in order to dispel illness caused by one of the ill winds and thereby restore harmony. (The term bajalica can be traced to an Indo-European root cognate with “speaking out:” Pokorny 1953:105-106; Kerewsky-Halpern and Foley 1978: 903-924). In a recent study I discuss the phonology, semantics and repetitive syntactic features of these basme and the resultant trance induction, biofeedback and other psychotherapeutic benefits such sound-bound intervention may effect (Kerewsky-Halpern 1985: 319-325)."
t0071 cite0204 EF06 "One of the important ways a bajalica mediates is by conjuring series of oral frames which function as mother metaphors. She might do this with familiar domestic animal mothers feeding their young on appropriate nourishment color-coded to match the particular wind-borne disease, e.g. the color yellow for jaundice. The bajalica, a human mother and therefore stronger than a symbolic mother, then “feeds” her patient a basma in the ritually prescribed manner. After the appropriate number of days of treatment the disease begins to wane. [Page -49-] Such ritual psychomancy enhanced by words often calls on the wolf (using the archaic term kurjak ) as co-mediator, the wolf being an agent of the devil and therefore a suitable helper for bridging the abyss from tu, “this world,” to otud, “out there” in the other world."
t0071 cite0204 EF06 "Throughout this form of ritual intervention the practitioner enacts her role as prototypical mother, validated by her biological attributes and rendered safe by age. To intercede in encounters with illness if not ritually clean would be unthinkable. (I myself could not be initiated into the secrets of bajanje until villagers perceived me as suitable recipient at the time that our eldest daughter became seen as a potential procreative vessel in our own family, thereby elevating me to the status of potential baba, “old woman” or fictive granny.) In function the bajalica’s mediation benefits the afflicted individual; in case of less positive outcome her intervention is recognized as harmless in any case."
t0072 cite0204 EF06 "A dangerous kind of ritual intervention is carried on by a vra[unknown]cara, a female practitioner who works with ritual objects more than with words. In the villages she is often known by a false name or a euphemism in order to deflect the evil eye. Encounters with a vra[unknown]cara can result in reversals of the intended outcome or in processes moving toward unanticipated outcomes. A few years ago a man who was psychologically impotent with his wife consulted a vra[unknown]cara two villages away. He visited her in secret, traveling on foot and under cover of darkness across a ravine, along mud paths skirting strips of cultivated fields. Chronologically he was [Page -50-] close in age to the practitioner. He addressed her as “ majko ”; she called him “ sinko, ” diminutive for “son.” Drawing a circle of string on the ground she instructed him to sit inside it and repeat a sequence of movements using his arm, now flexed, now extended. The circle was a female sexual symbol and the arm a symbolic penis. The vraćara soothingly told her client that she understood he was temporarily impotent with his wife because of guilt over his attentions to a local widow across the glen. The client was amazed that the vraćara knew this detail of his private life, which further confirmed his trust in her."
t0072 cite0204 EF06 "A year later I learned that the widow, jealous of her former lover’s attentions to his own wife, had visited the same vra[unknown]cara and had put a curse on him, rendering him impotent with all women. The widow said, “Thank God for women like her. Without her powers how would I even the score?” The man himself fumed, “That she-devil! That sorcerer! Where the devil needs someone to do his work, he sends a woman!” The vra[unknown]cara, calmly disassociating herself from claims of evil-doing said, “I ’dream up’ what I have to do,” thus absolving herself from conscious responsibility while maintaining her reputation as a woman of manipulative power."
t0073 cite0128 EF06 "Every morning finds a knot of people outside the health room door in the Cooperative Home, usually old men seeking pills or injections, plus mothers with sniffling children and the occasional emergency. Twice a week a doctor comes from Arandjelovac. It is becoming increasingly rare for a woman to have her baby at home. She goes to the maternity center in Arandjelovac or, if she lives in the far section of the village in the direction of Mladenovac, she uses the center there. Despite frequent resort to folk practitioners for various psychosomatic ailments and some types of infectious diseases, modern medical techniques are eagerly sought. This is so notwithstanding the fact that the private farmer must pay for certain examinations and medicines. The costs are not exorbitant, although the amount charged for long stays in the hospital can become burdensome. However, certain serious illnesses such as tuberculosis and cancer are treated free of charge. A large number of villagers, being former mine workers or presently industrial, agricultural (state) or white collar workers, are eligible for free care for themselves and their families."
t0074 cite0074 EF06 "In practice, the peasant is forced into a dualism which can distort the original value of institutions. As a rule he is neither so advanced that his religion, his Christianity, does not include ‘superstition’, nor so uncritical that his magic-working does not call in the help of his faith ( vera ). At the same time he reserves his magic proper—the processes in which an element of something other than religious faith and something other than human skill or clearly understood action upon matter is introduced to produce a desired semi-miraculous effect—for ends of self-interest, for instance, as distinct from a higher order of emotional or spiritual needs. However sure he may be of his magic, its use is signalled by a certain unsureness in dealing with things which he cannot see, which seem to him to be wholly or partly caused by a mysterious non-human factor, one over which he has no direct control through the senses, or force with which the ordinary man has no direct intelligible means of communication. Practices which the folk-lorist sometimes groups under one rubric, Magic, are departmentalised in peasant usage. Bajanje, for instance, is a concept which can be nearly covered by ‘exorcism’. It is the art of healing by pronouncing an incantation—almost always concerned with spirits—accompanied by gestures or action on the part of someone who has acquired a special virtue. Vra[unknown]canje, in Serbia, properly means the art of divining the cause of an illness and, usually, providing an antidote (a sympathetic cure or one based on analogy). It is a term also used in a more general sense. But we speak of ‘turning back’ a disease or spell ( zavr[unknown]cati, etc.). 1 Le[unknown]cenje is properly [Page 109] healing with herbal drugs. [unknown]Caranje ( [unknown]cinjenje, etc.) is the art of casting and removing spells, with or without the assistance of spirits. Magija is a far less common word, and is most often applied to malicious magic and demonic influences. Gatanje is simply the practice of divining and fortune telling, not necessarily providing a cure, with cards, string, beads, lead and water, etc. Every popular specialist is known to practise one particular method which has its own distinct professional name."
t0074 cite0074 EF06 "The magic of spirit-beings is also personally directed, and must be counteracted by similar magic. On the other hand, a number of rituals and of curses, which at first sight seem ‘magical’ in form, are not understood by the peasant at all in this way. They belong to his religious sentiments, to a sphere of reactions much more complex and much less tangible. Seasonal, family and tribal ceremonies are now part of law and custom, and reverenced with all the emotions of religion. Incidental magic, healing magic, for instance, is not custom; it is in no sense obligatory; its ends are practical and its results are foregone conclusions, barring accident. It is not founded on any sentiment of duty; it is not regularised, though what we vaguely define as religion and magic can both be served by the same ritual. The magical side, however, embraces more than anti-social purposes and is almost a substitute for personal religion, to which as a rule the peasant pays little heed. His real ‘religion’ belongs to group-practice, and so strong is this ancient instinct that group-interests and loyalties predominate over personal. The peasant may believe literally the teaching of the church, the promise of salvation, the duty of confession, the consequences of mortal sin; but custom, group-interest, can override these precepts, demand the blood of an enemy, the pursuance of vengeance, the neglect of sacraments, and all this he will sacrifice, admitting that he runs a danger of damnation and hoping that an opportunity for reconciliation will turn up later on. ... The forms of religion enter into healing practice, but seldom all the feelings associated with a religious act. Leeches, witches and sick men intercede with spirits and make offerings to them, but although there is always a fear of offending them, their status is not that of gods who are worshipped, but of mysterious beings with whom it is better to be on friendly terms. The peasant seldom has a separate word for prayer—e.g. church prayers—and exorcism or healing formula."
t0075 cite0074 EF06 "Some village doctors have a wide knowledge of cures; the surgeons frequently combine herbal medicine with their other arts; but of all these who treat several diseases very few use more than two dozen different drugs all told, and many more make do with two or three, sometimes saying that these will cure any and every ill. Specialisation is usual. There are specialists in skin diseases, in hernia, in cancer, in epilepsy, in typhus, in the care of wounds, in cataract, and so on. Besides which there are domestic simples known to nearly every household."
t0075 cite0074 EF06 "The barber class chiefly dress wounds, extract bullets, let blood, apply leeches, treat for venereal disease, and draw teeth—and all these things they do at the present time in Old Serbia and Southern Serbia and Kosovo, and in Bosnia and in Hercegovina whenever they can avoid the interference of the authorities. These barbers are mainly Mohammedans, Turks, Albanians, occasionally Greeks. It is amongst them that the elements of oriental pharmacy are found. Their practice is fairly stereotyped, and hereditary. Most of them still keep old-fashioned instruments, which have sometimes been in the family for many generations—a set of bronze cups, a cow’s horn, a circular or square cutting instrument, a tooth screw, a spring-set wart cutter, some rather rough tweezers, a wire probe, and the razors used for shaving. [Page [facing page 225]] These, with the knives of circumcision, complete the armamentarium of Turkish surgery in these parts."
t0075 cite0074 EF06 "The peasant doctor, on the other hand, seldom has any special instruments, but employs ordinary knives, sharp stones, crystals, thorns, lumps of sugar, needles, coins, and what he himself can make out of wood, such as splints. Here and there a special silver needle is kept for acupuncture and inoculation. Feathers are used in applying salves. The sorcerer or seeress has generally a black-handled knife, which should be made or specially or ritually prepared; and the rest of the paraphernalia is selected from objects in common use."
t0075 cite0074 EF06 "The barbers and travelling doctors have a fixed scale of charges, and so have many village specialists. When a man cannot pay immediately, he is required to leave a pledge. Such specialists can draw patients from a great distance, and make considerable profits, though in fear of restrictions, due, they say, to the jealousy of the gentlemen doctors. Most of them provide the drug, or prepare it specially for each patient; many keep a stock of their standard ointment or medicine; some only give advice and oral prescriptions. At Otok it was believed that the doctors would lose the protection of the vile if they charged more than a certain minimum fee. Those who write charms, and these are mostly Mohammedan hodjas, have also a fixed tariff."
t0075 cite0074 EF06 "Before the coming of qualified doctors to Serbia (first in 1819) who, until the foundation of the Medical Faculty at Belgrade in 1920, were trained abroad, and in early times were exclusively foreigners, the arts of healing were practised regularly by various native self-taught doctors, folk-doctors proper, and by travelling specialists, such as the kaliatroi from Epirus. These latter, whose learning was generally hereditary, travelled mostly in groups, and as far as Bosnia and Serbia. Members of this old school are still found in remoter places of the South and in Albania. In the provinces under Turkey the same system continued until very recent years, with here and there an oriental trained doctor in the towns."
t0075 cite0074 EF06 "Orthodox monasteries also undertook the care of sick persons, mainly the demented, but seldom offered any method of treatment other than prayer and fasting and castigation and the stocks. Even in Croatia and Slovenia, European medicine has been familiar only in larger towns. The first qualified doctors in Serbia were Greeks, Italians and Austrians, who attended the Obrenović family and a very small number of richer persons. In the early years of the nineteenth century, the National Soviet gave special privileges and diplomas to certain self-taught men, especially to those who had served as military surgeons. Mili[unknown]cević mentions Ećim Toma Kostić, the son of a village wise woman, who was made a regular army doctor with a salary, in 1806. These were all popular doctors, rather than true folk-doctors. In 1813 the official archives refer to a Greek of Smyrna at Belgrade; a gendarme who had shown skill in bone-setting and was granted a pension in 1835; a certain Sava Jovanović who applied what he had learnt from watching Dr B. C. Kunibert, a court physician; a former slave in the service of a Greek doctor at Smyrna, who specialised in skin and venereal disease—all these and others had special permission to practise. An order of 1836 fixes the fee of a visit, and provides for the free attendance of the poor. Lindermayer for this period notices three principal operations carried out by folk-doctors: amputation, lithotomy and removing films from the surface of the eye. Military records contain startling evidence of apparently successful, if rough, handling. Pirch, in 1829, says that village doctors treated accidents, where perhaps learned medicine would have advocated the loss of a limb, but which were in this manner perfectly healed without leaving any trace. In 1824 a monk Inćentije, in the region of U[unknown]zica, was reported to cut for tumours and swellings in the neck, and that not one of his patients but afterwards died or regretted it. A village doctor appears to have run a regular hospital or clinic for syphilitic patients, about 1836, and to have obtained semi-official recognition. Monasteries were required to provide for the sick and to undertake the cure of the demented [Page 227] ‘by the methods which they know’. Rich Turks also kept their own doctors, who amongst other duties prepared poisons for their enemies. Otherwise the mass of the people relied upon their village wise women and herb doctors."
t0076 cite0074 EF06 "A folk-doctor is reported to have cut out a cancerous growth on the upper lip and cauterised the wound with a red-hot iron. He then applied an ointment and, when the ulcer reappeared later in the same place, he inserted a piece of arsenic and bound up the wound. At the present time a doctor has become famous in Montenegro, and as far as Berane, for curing cancer ( rak ) by cutting away the growth and binding on green figs ‘with other herbs’. This method he [Page 254] is supposed to have learned from a former surgeon of the Montenegrin court, a Russian. A spreading or festering wound ( [unknown]ziva rana ) should be cut away all round to prevent it spreading. The following ointment is used specifically for a cancer: fresh butter, beeswax, water, tallow and incense are slowly heated together, and the shredded green endoderm of Sambucus nigra added; the mixture is cooked until it becomes a thick yellow mass (near Berane)."
t0077 cite0074 EF06 "Wounds may receive different treatment according to whether they are caused by bullets, by sharp instruments, and so on. To stop the flow of blood from a wound it may be held tightly between the fingers or bound; cases in which the folk-doctor has joined a severed artery are known. ... As a note on the subject of specialisation, this surgeon remarked that a bullet could be best extracted by a barber surgeon. An Albanian of the same district said that, in the old days, and now for the matter of that, he never used anything for a wound but stale goat’s cheese, which was the best and handiest remedy, and drew out the bullet. An Albanian, practising folk-surgeon and veterinary surgeon at Vrelo, who made extensive journeys in and out of Albania and Montenegro, gave me [Page 257] the following: Heat about half a litre of olive oil and add a small piece of pine tar, the size of a walnut, a similar quantity of incense and of sheep fat, and a rather smaller lump of beeswax (he used more incense in his mixture than any other prescription known to me) and after mixing and adding these things gradually over the fire, add three herbs, which he called stog, pësmëtin and bar i hajl (‘dog’s weed’). ... Although for the treatment of cattle there was a fixed tariff, he seldom took anything unless a voluntary present or his expenses for curing a wound. A story which reflected both to his moral credit and professional code tells that he had even cured where he was owed blood."
t0078 cite0074 EF06 "Bandaging is generally the work of women specialists. It is most frequently found in connection with the care of the pregnant woman or afterbirth or to adjust a fallen womb. The belt or bandage generally consists of several metres of stout woven material which is wound fairly tightly, beginning low down on the back and sometimes extending beyond the navel. In Serbia, at the present time, where limitation of the family is becoming a more and more usual and even recognised practice, the foetus is expelled by a lengthy and exhausting massage, and some of the village midwives adjust bandages after the operation, and between two instalments of an operation. This is practically the only aid to healing given after an abortion. In Bosnia the following interesting customs came to my notice. As a precaution during pregnancy, in the case of a woman who has before suffered a miscarriage, for instance, she should go to a water mill and take a long grass or straw from the mill wheel, and gird herself with it, taking care for forty days afterwards not to cross running water. Or she should have a ring made out of the shoe of a dead horse and wear it round her waist next the skin."
t0079 cite0205 EF06 "Modernization has meant increased access to Western medical facilities. Women now give birth in hospitals rather than at home. However, for some types of illnesses, help is still solicited from a VRACAR or VRACARA.

Ritual specialties are vigorously promoted in Okop Sukkun, and many of the younger men are learning them; in Ustuppu, virtually all of the [curing] specialists are old men who must rely upon other communities for students, if they are to have any at all. In Okop Sukkun the two major ceremonies involving the entire community-- the puberty feast and the exorcism rite called Apsoket 6 -- are performed regularly with energy and enthusiasm; in Ustuppu interest in such activities has flagged and the ceremonies, when performed, are lax and somewhat disorganized. It has reached the point where, within the past few years, several conservative fathers from Ustuppu, anxious for the welfare of their daughters, have petitioned the village of Okop Sukkun to hold puberty feasts for them."

[AL note: some discussion about translations and language learning follows] ...

I was also able to understand virtually everything in the curing chants, save the ritual names of various spirits, when performed."
t0082 cite0075 SB05 "To correct this situation, it must first be noted that there are numerous named status positions among the Kuna (see Figure 10). At the broadest level, these may conveniently be divided into political and ritual fields (Howe 1974:Chapters 4, 5 & 6). Diagnosis and treatment of illness fall within the province of ritual, and the specialists who engage in these activities are the nele (‘seer’), the inatulet(i) (‘medicine man’), and the ikarwisit (‘knower of chants’). Aside from midwives, who concern themselves solely with deliverying babies, there are no other types of professionals involved in the curing process. 2 The masartulet (death chanter) and the kantule (puberty chanter), together with several other minor ritual specialists in the puberty ceremony, are not considered curing professionals by the Kuna. 3"
t0082 cite0075 SB05 "2 The midwives ( muukana) should probably be called “quasi-specialists,” for they do have a recognized profession and gain status from their work. However, they are not seen by the Kuna as ‘people who know things’ in the strict sense of ritual. This is because they do not gather or prepare medicines (all they do is administer them); nor do they peform chants."

Later, when they have gained experience, they are allowed to handle ‘genuine’ ( sunsoket) or ‘principal” ( itualet) medicines such as ‘demon medicine’ ( nia ina), ‘midwife (pregnancy) medicine’ ( muu ina), and ‘vine (snake) medicine’ ( tupa ina).

By the same token, a man from Okop Sukkun is recognized as the most outstanding specialist in eye ailments. Two other men from the same community, together with a specialist from Ustuppu, are the most highly respected snake medicine doctors; and so forth. Every community strives to maintain a wide variety of medical specialists, but this is difficult in the smaller villages of San Blas. Consequently, steps are sometimes taken by village elders to send specialists to other regions of San Blas or the Bayano in order to learn curing traditions which are lacking in their home communities. 17"
t0083 cite0075 SB05 "17 Sherzer taped an interesting account by a medicine man from Mulatuppu who had just returned from the Bayano, where he had learned snake medicine. He had been sent by the community to learn this branch, which was vitally needed in Mulatuppu, on a community “scholarship” (Sherzer 1980)."
t0083 cite0075 SB05 "Although no medical professions are full-time occupations, many specialists devote a tremendous amount of time and effort to the acquisition of skills. 18 They actively seek out experts who possess knowledge in particular areas and become their disciples. Dedicated medicine men may study under as many [Page 147] as ten or more different specialists, and sometimes travel far afield to spend months at a time expanding their knowledge with especially distinguished practitionars. In fact, the education of the most active medicine men never really ends. They often pass leisure hours discussing medicines, chants, diseases, and curing with their peers. Even men in their sixties who have already built up formidable reputations attach themselves to specialists who are well-versed in branches of medicines the former do not know."
t0083 cite0075 SB05 "18 In his later years, Nele Kantule of Ustuppu came close to being a full-time teacher of ritual and political tradition. He spent virtually all of his time in the village with his students, and seldom worked in his fields."
t0084 cite0075 SB05 "The men of Kuna households engage in subsistence activities which usually take them away from the community early in the morning, and when they return in the afternoon they [Page 175] characteristically go about small tasks around the house, rest, or visit with friends. Because the women so thoroughly monopolize the patient, they are clearly in the best position to know what his or her problems are. Occasionally, a specialist will appear to question the patient directly, but the women are invariably the ones who carry out most of the detective work. They study the symptoms, reconstruct the past few days, and dredge up relevant facts from the patient’s biography. They discuss their findings among themselves, while neighboring women, lured to the scene with hopes of uncovering the latest gossip, drop by to offer their opinions. Households in which someone has recently fallen ill frequently become packed with women absorbed in the case; and near-by houses periodically send representatives over to find out about the most recent developments."
t0085 cite0075 SB05 "Medicine counselling chants are performed by specialists before the medicines are turned over to the patient [Page 257] or the women attending him. 32 In this connection, it is important to note that counselling chants contain information for the medicines, not the patient, and for this reason they are addressed directly to the medicines. It should also be pointed out that the performance of these chants is the only absolutely necessary action of the medical specialist in the curing process. The medicines themselves are often prepared by the specialist’s wife or his students, although the specialist provides instructions on how this should be done. And once the medicines have been counselled, they are frequently taken to the patient’s home by someone other than the specialist himself."
t0085 cite0075 SB05 "32 It is not important that the person who ultimately counsels the medicines is the one who has collected them. Many specialists have a covey of students who are on their way to becoming adept botanists, and they are frequently sent into the jungle with a list of plants to collect. When this is done, responsible medicine men inspect the medicines to make sure the selection has been made correctly before they counsel them. The medicines are gathered, prepared, counselled by a medical specialist, and then taken to the patient. Only the most insignificant medicines may be used without the intervention of a specialists at some point in the process."
t0085 cite0075 SB05 "Beverages are also used as medicine for throat ailments. Many curing specialists are afflicted with throats which have ‘dried up’ ( tinkusa) because of constant chanting and inhaling the smoke of noxious plants such as chile peppers. In fact, most older specialists have difficulty making their way through longer chants without pausing frequently to cough up phlegm and taking a few swallows of throat medicine, which they keep in small pots at their side."
t0086 cite0075 SB05 "All medicinal treatments for serious illnesses or for the purpose of investing patients with powerful positive qualities are undertaken in seclusion and according to rigid regimen. Persons afflicted with severe infections, corrosive skin diseases, and ailments caused by ‘demons’ ( niakana) are kept tightly guarded in the homes of specialists, in their own homes, or in huts erected at some distance from the village. Visitors are discouraged and are sometimes restrained entirely from [Page 284] entering. 53 This rarely poses a problem, however, for knowledge of the virulent nature of the attacking poni is generally sufficient to keep would-be intruders away."
t0086 cite0075 SB05 "53 This makes things difficult for nosy ethnographers intent upon investigating cases of this sort. Once when I attempted to find out more about a girl who had been attacked by nia, I was effectively barred from the house. Although I knew the family of the patient well, several old women met me at the door and made it very clear, in a friendly yet insistent manner, that I was not welcome. This behavior is generally not the case with less severe illnesses."
t0087 cite0075 SB05 "The victim of a poisonous snake-bite should sit down immediately, remain as immobile as possible, and call for aid. As soon as helpers arrive, they bathe themselves to lower their nika level, for strong nika is dangerous to the victim’s weakened purpa. If some knowledge of medicines is present among those who have come to aid the victim, medicines are gathered and preliminary treatment is given. A specialist in snake medicine is sent for, and it is he who determines the seriousness of the bite. The victim is then carried carefully to a canoe in which medicines are placed. If the wound is minor, it is generally treated on the spot, and the victim is taken to his home, where treatment will continue. However, most victims [Page 288] of snake-bite are transported to a small thatched hut located some distance from the community, either on a nearby uninhabited island or on the mainland. 60 This is usually done in the late afternoon, when activities in the community have quieted down."
t0087 cite0075 SB05 "60 The Ustuppu snake-bite hut, which is mentioned by Nordenshiold (1938: 397), is no longer a permanent structure. When needed, it is hastily constructed. However, virtually all victims of snake-bite are now taken directly to the Ailikanti hospital."
t0087 cite0075 SB05 "At this point, a medicine man skilled in the treatment of snake-bite takes full charge of the case. The only people allowed near the hut are the assistants of the medicine man and older members of the patient’s family. Young people are excluded from the proceedings, for their nika is too strong and will cause harm to the patient; and pregnant women are strictly prohibited, for their bloated purpakana may attack and cause the victim’s purpa to swell. As soon as possible, the patient’s family presents the principal specialist with a string of multi-colored glass beads, which he places around his neck for the ceremony to follow (Figure 20); this gift is accompanied by a small number of sewing needles and fish hooks. If the specialist does not receive these items, he himself will be vulnerable to attack by snake ponikana (Nordenskiold 1938:397-8). 61"
t0087 cite0075 SB05 "61 The necklace is perceived as similar to the patterned designs on the skin of a snake; the needles and fish hooks represent the snake’s fangs. The multi-colored bead necklaces are frequently worn by snake medicine men even when they are not working on a case, and serve as identity badges."
t0087 cite0075 SB05 "The principal snake-bite medicine man from the island was away on a trip at the time, so the case was handed over to another man, the chief of Sasarti, who knew a good deal less about snake medicine. The victim was not taken to a snake-bite hut on the mainland, but brought to the specialist’s house in Sasarti. The island was sealed off completely. A red flag was hoisted as a warning to approaching canoes that they should not beach on the island, and no villagers were allowed to visit the mainland. 70 All noise was prohibited. Sherzer was informed that he could play his tape recordings softly in the morning, but in the evening even this had to be stopped. A ring of guards was posted around the site of the ceremony, and another surrounded the entire neighborhood. While the treatment was [Page 295] in effect, there was some dissatisfaction over the measures being taken by the specialist in charge, and a number of special gatherings were called in Mulatuppu. These gatherings were short, directly to the point, and conducted in whispers so as not to endanger the patient. The fears of the village leaders were later substantiated when the patient came down with gangrene. The illness was clearly too much for the specialist’s limited abilities, and the patient was taken to the hospital at Ailikanti, where he was eventually cured."
t0088 cite0075 SB05 "At one end of the birth house, hammocks are tied from beams so as to face two small “birth enclosures” which are walled off from sight by pieces of cloth and leaves (Figure 29). The expectant mother is then positioned in the hammock at the center. She is flanked on either side by the principal midwife and her assistants, as well as by elderly women from the patient’s family. All of the women present have passed the age of childbearing, and the patient’s mother is usually not present. 16 It is important to note that the patient is directly attended to exclusively by women; men who involve themselves in the proceedings remain peripheral to the central core of action. Medicine men, who periodically bring medicines, leave them with the midwives to administer to the patient. A nele might be called in to confer with the midwives and offer his diagnosis. To do this, he interprets signs the midwives have observed in the behavior or physical condition of the pregnant woman, peers into the world of spirit, or, as is usually the case, weighs both sets of evidence. The third male specialist is the chanter of Muu Ikar (‘The Way of Muu’), who [Page 401] will perform only if birth is delayed and his intervention is deemed necessary by the shaman and the midwives. Under normal circumstances, none of these male specialists touches the patient or manipulates her physically in any way. 17 Medicine men are involved in counselling the spirits of the medicines they bring, and the nele is concerned with symptoms on the spiritual level. The chanter of Muu Ikar enters into a dialogue with his spirit helpers who will attempt to rescue the spirit of the fetus, should this is necessary. ..."
t0088 cite0075 SB05 "The purpose of Muu Ikar is to assemble a host of shaman spirits and direct them on a journey to Muu’s house, where they will liberate the spirit of the fetus and return it to the birth house. This chant, like those discussed in preceding chapters, is a “script” in which the events described are understood to occur in the world of spirit as the words come out of the chanter’s mouth. If the specialist is skillfull and is able to demonstrate that he knows the spirits he is dealing with thoroughly, the actors in the drama -- protagonists and antagonists alike -- will be forced to follow the script. In this way, order is restored to the world of spirit, and the road [Page 407] is cleared for childbirth. On the other hand, if birth does not take place as expected, and there is no indication that the mother’s condition is improving, a new diagnosis is made and the chant repeated. The second chant may be modified in content, length, and emphasis according to the new diagnosis. ..."
t0088 cite0075 SB05 "The older women of the house are in anguish, they are sobbing. They decide to solicit the assistance of the Muu Ikar specialist, and the mother of the pregnant woman sets out to find him. She arrives at his house, and after a short exchange he agrees to take the case, observing at the same time that ‘only my shamans, my spirits know (if we will succeed).’ He bathes, changes his clothes, and walks through the streets with his silver walking stick to the woman’s house."
t0088 cite0075 SB05 "The specialist approaches the woman’s hammock, positions himself on a golden stool, and begins to chant. Simultaneously, he drops chile peppers into the clay brazier at his feet and smoke rises in the air. The woman is agonizing, she is looking along Muu’s road, she is calling out in pain. In Muu’s house, ‘the angry ones have placed a bead necklace around her [Page 410] neck.’ 21 Muu’s cloths continue shutting around the woman, trapping her."
t0089 cite0075 SB05 "The midwives, of course, have never performed the chant, but they have worked so closely with muu ikar specialists over long years that they generally have complete control of the language and the content of the chant."
t0090 cite0206 SB05 "After these came ten great Neles, one of whom was a woman, who had great powers over the elements, knew many medicines, and who made many journeys to the underworld and heaven; reporting to the people what they had seen, upon their return. The exploits of these mythical heroes grade into accounts of chiefs and heroes who led the Cuna in wars with the Spanish, and guided the San Blas Cuna down from the mountains and out onto the islands. Neles and other specialists in the supernatural often have interpretations somewhat different from those held by the laity. There is a series of creation myths in which a culture hero Ibelele is credited with the origin of many things, and as with myths connected with Ibeorkun and his teachings, they are used as sanction for proper behavior in the ‘singing’ meetings. Actually, most specialists consider Ibelele, not as the creator of these things, but only the discoverer of what God created. These myths may be used in social control, for parts of them can be found to fit any situation. The teachings of these culture heroes seem as important as fear of punishment by God, either through the agency of evil spirits while here on earth, or in after worlds, as sanctions for proper behavior.’ Many of these myths teach much of the best in Christianity, and Nordenskiöld feels that these concepts came from Huguenots or Catholic missionaries. Though admitting a certain amount of [Page 217b] stimulus diffusion, the author fails to see much which is not inculcated as ideal behavior in many societies; though perhaps not as explicitly as in Cuna lore.”"
t0091 cite0077 SB05 "In Ustúpu there is an eye specialist. He bathes the eye with water into which certain herbs have been laid after having been ground and filtered. A cloth is used as a filter. It is in order to give sharper sight ( ib˘ia eye, okannoe give strength). Even rose water is used for the eyes. The thorns are used against rheumatism."
t0092 cite0078 SB05 "During the day specialists gather medicinal plants in the mainland jungle and render the medicine effective by performing incantations to it. Chants are performed regularly as part of the curing process and for a variety of magical purposes. ..."
t0092 cite0078 SB05 "While there are structure and unity, both official and unofficial, at the level of the Kuna as an ethnic group, the most intense, active, day-to-day organization is at the level of the village. Politically, each village has its own organization consisting of ‘chiefs’ and other officials. In addition, each village has other ritual leaders—specialists in medicine, curing, magic, and puberty rites. Ideally each village is politically and ritually complete, each possible Kuna role being filled. But, while this ideal is met and by necessity must be met in the political organization (see chapters 2 and 3), this is not so with regard to other ritual roles. Some roles have more than one occupant in a particular village; others have none at all. Once again, village size is an important factor. The larger a village is, the more specialists one is likely to find living in it. This means that inhabitants of smaller villages might find it necessary to go outside the village for the curing of particular diseases or the performance of particular rituals—expensive and time-consuming operations."
t0093 cite0078 SB05 "After a disease has been diagnosed by a ‘seer,’ the cure is achieved by means of medicine gathered and prepared by an inatulet (medicinal specialist) and the performance of the appropriate curing ikar (way, text) by an ikar wisit ( ikar knower). The ‘medicinal specialist’ is an expert in the pharmaceutical properties of local plants and animals. At the behest of clients—patients or patients’ families—he searches for and prepares medicine. But this is not sufficient in itself. For the medicine to be potent and effective, it must be advised and given life. This is achieved by means of chants called ina uanaet (medicine counsel) which are directed to the medicine and the spirits of the medicine by the ‘medicinal specialist.’ Thus the task of the ‘medicinal specialist’ is twofold: in part to be knowledgeable about local medicine, in part to know the chant appropriate to each type of medicine."
t0094 cite0078 SB05 "The three Kuna ritual traditions, while independent of one another, can also be in conflict. There are ‘medicinal specialists’ who do not attend meetings in the ‘gathering house’ and who publicly affirm their disinterest in its tradition. Their prestige and influence emerge from their own domain. On the other hand, ‘chiefs’ and other political leaders are critical of individuals who do not participate in ‘gatherings’ and sometimes try to force their participation. A concrete example of the competition between the ‘gathering’ and curing traditions is the habit of certain ‘ ikar knowers’ to practice, booming out their texts for all to hear, in a house near the ‘gathering house’ on evenings when men’s talking meetings are held there."
t0094 cite0078 SB05 "Each curing and magical ikar exists in different versions. Ideally all are equally effective. But in practice some ‘ ikar knowers’ have reputations for knowing an ikar better or for knowing more effective versions. When a teacher and students of the same ikar live in the same village, they are ranked, with the teacher being ranked highest. Teachers and students often criticize each other. Students claim that their teacher will not let them finish learning an ikar or that he will not admit that they have learned it. Teachers argue that their students have not completely mastered the ikar. This is no doubt one of [Page 69] the major reasons why it is common practice to learn an ikar from a renowned teacher from a distant village: In this way both teacher and student gain prestige and at the same time avoid subsequent conflict. Also, certain ‘knowers’ learn their ikarkana in dreams from spirits or deceased specialists. While these ‘knowers’ have patients and students, there is antagonism toward them on the part of those ‘knowers’ who have learned in the more ordinary way, with a live, human teacher, especially if they claim to be specialists in the same ikar."
t0094 cite0078 SB05 "Since Kuna ritual roles involve the learning of long and often difficult verbal traditions, it is relatively older men who achieve positions of leadership. Furthermore, certain verbal traditions, especially the most prestigious, are in practice restricted to older men. Younger men must apprentice themselves to older leaders, specialists, and teachers and wait their turn—this causes considerable frustration on the part of the younger men. Because of this social and political situation, coupled with economic pressures, Kuna men are leaving their villages in increasing numbers and staying away longer than in the past. The unfortunate result is that San Blas villages are losing some of their most intelligent young men, who prefer cooking and washing dishes in Panama City to the economic and social frustrations of San Blas."
t0095 cite0078 SB05 "Varying approaches to curing can cause differences of opinion. A particularly good example has to do with snakebite. This is a very sensitive area in that the Kuna are agriculturalists and the jungle mainland is populated by a number of very dangerous snakes. There are curing specialists who believe that in the treatment of snakebites, because evil spirits abound, the entire village must be involved. In extreme cases this might mean the prohibition of work in the jungle and the prohibition of noise in the village, especially at night. Radios are silenced, people are told to walk barefoot, and ‘gatherings’ are either canceled or held in a whisper; no chanting is permitted. Other specialists, however, disagree. They hold that if a curing specialist is adequately trained, if he is truly an expert, he should be able to cure a snakebite victim rapidly without the need to disrupt village life—medicine, ikarkana, and ‘secrets’ should suffice."
t0095 cite0078 SB05 "These differences can lead to conflict, especially when the principal exponents of the different approaches live in the same village."
t0096 cite0078 SB05 "‘Medicinal specialists,’ ‘ ikar knowers,’ and kanturkana learn their professions through years of study with well-known, respected specialists from their own and especially from other, often distant villages. The student lives with the teacher and helps him with various activities, from farming to gathering medicine. As they work together, they talk about various types of medicine, how and where to find them, and what their function is. An important aspect of the acquisition of curing techniques is the learning of the names of the different medicines and the diseases or problems they are used for."
t0096 cite0078 SB05 "The teaching of magical ikarkana involves a focus on memorization of a fixed text, which must be learned completely and exactly. An ‘ ikar knower’ or a kantule knows his text perfectly and can repeat it identically when performing it in the context of its magical function or when teaching it to others. In teaching sessions, the specialist performs a section of the ikar and the student repeats it, the teacher correcting him when he makes a mistake or cannot think of the next line. Ikar learning involves considerable effort—long ikarkana, such as ‘the way of the mass curer’ or ‘the way of the kantule,’ require many years of study. Learning is made particularly difficult by the fact that the verbal text must first be perfectly memorized before the teacher explains the meanings of the words and the symbolism. The students of the ‘mass curer’ and the kantule have official roles in the rituals themselves, including performing ikarkana along with the teacher. In this way, the students gain recognition for [Page 226] their efforts, learn their texts through actual practice, and are socialized into their ritual role."
t0096 cite0078 SB05 "Another way in which an ikar can be learned is in dreams, in which case the teacher is either a representative of the spirit world who knows the ikar or a deceased person who knew the ikar when she or he was alive. The ikar is learned in a series of dreamed sessions. It is especially ‘seers,’ who have supernatural mental ability, who can learn ikarkana in dreams. But others can study this way too. Sometimes, individuals who desire to learn ikarkana in dreams take special medicine. While the medicine might work, it can also produce undesirable effects; in particular, it can result in the person’s unwittingly causing sickness and even death to others. Individuals who have learned ikarkana in dreams are accepted as specialists by the community in varying degrees. Their ability is verified through public performance, and they also acquire students. At the same time, they are open to criticism from specialists who have learned their ikarkana from live teachers through hard, tedious work and some form of payment. Such individuals are prone to voice skepticism about others who claim to have learned by another, less overt, and obviously less verifiable process. ..."
t0096 cite0078 SB05 "As a result of this interplay between official and unofficial knowledge, the actual relationship between knowers and understanders of tradition tends to lie along a continuum rather than be a dichotomy between specialists and nonspecialists, as the official version would have it. This makes it possible for ritual language and tradition to be both secretive and nonsecretive, esoteric and nonesoteric, at the same time. Specialists gain prestige for their knowledge and performance, but nonspecialists are not totally frozen out. Performances can be appreciated by many individuals to varying degrees, and participation in ritual events is encouraged. Kuna ritual leaders constantly profess a desire to transmit their knowledge to individuals eager to learn. They complain that nowadays people are no longer interested. The learning of ritual knowledge is open to everyone—anyone who is willing has the right to study and eventually to become a specialist. 7 As a result, most people have at least a little understanding of ritual matters."
t0097 cite0080 NV09 "Curers and doctors differ most obviously in that doctors are ladinos and curers tend to be Indians (although ladino curers are known). In addition, they deal with illnesses in sufficiently contrastive ways so that two role identifying labels must be maintained. They are both recognized to be able to reduce illness (as a basis for further inference and action) by prescribing medicines that can be purchased in the pharmacy. These may be taken orally, injected, or applied as a salve. The doctor further prescribes and may himself perform some minor surgery, X-ray examinations, and other traditional Western-European [Page 123] strategies for diagnosing and reducing illness. The curer does not engage in surgery, nor does he prescribe any of the more complex testing procedures whose results he does not imagine himself to be able to interpret. Instead, he recommends additional substances he purchased from the pharmacy such as tallow, wines, herbs in aguardientes as well as substances which are sometimes found in domesticated state, and more often found wild in the general vicinity of Aguacatenango. These include some kinds of flowers, bark, leaves, roots, stems, flesh of animals and fishes, animal waste products, eggs and so on. These substances are variously taken orally, applied externally, or inhaled as steam. Unlike doctors, curers practice bleeding and cupping; they also administer some medications in the form of steam while the patient is seated on a platform over a fire. They incorporate adornment of the sick-bed into curing ritual. The ritual may also include prayer. Most important, perhaps, the curers undertake to examine the recent life history of the individual who is ill, in terms of the possibility that the individual has encountered some disease producing entity which can explain, in his particular case, the onset of the disease process. There is no illness for which the curer does not have an explanation together with a set of strategies for dealing with it. At present, at least one curer, when confronted with very serious cases, will refer his patient to a doctor, but this does [Page 124] not yet appear to be a popular alternative. Generally, the doctor is the last of all medical practitioners referred to in exhausting the curing options in Aguacatenango, though individuals who have had a successful relationship with the doctor are more likely to pursue that option sooner. The only other major class of medical practitioners is the talking saint. Talking saints are more or less representational images of saints who, in conjunction with their “owners” can actively consult with human beings about their trials and tribulations in the world. The most powerful of this class, San Miguel of Soyaló, is about an eight hour trip and a 200 peso fee from Aguacatenango. Talking saints share more features with the curers than they do with doctors. They, like the curers, are predestined by God to their role, but they more directly represent God's omniscience. The cure of the talking sai it is more powerful as can be measured by the greater expenditure of funds for such a cure, or as can be measured by his greater ability to divine in the life history of the patient the principal sources of illness."
t0098 cite0081 NU33 "The herb doctors, while really not considered shamans, are noted for their vast knowledge of the curative properties of herbs. Generally, these men cure without music, drinking, or remuneration. They are druggists, comparatively speaking, and furnish medicine to the Indians. However, some attain fame and gain a livelihood through their practice. This was especially true of Jesús, a doctor in Guadalupe pueblo. He was exceptional in having the rank of a full-time practitioner. The more Mexicanized of these doctors may know and use simple store medicines. A maggot-extracting doctor would not use a store medicine even if he knew about it. ..."
t0098 cite0081 NU33 "In a sense, the Tarahumaras do not formally recognize this classification. The name oorúgame applies to all shamans, with the possible exception of herb doctors and chanters, although Lumholtz insists the chanters are classed as shamans. Differences in qualifications, however, are clearly recognized by the Indians themselves. They know that there are doctors who may use peyote and others who may not. They recognize the fact that some shamans can extract maggots, and they honor them accordingly. The chanters are easily distinguished. If one wishes to have the dutubúri sung and danced, the chanter must be invited. The Indian may invite a regular shaman as well for some other part of the fiesta . The chanters are given the name of sawéame, meaning “he who uses the rattle [ sawáka ].” ..."

t0099 cite0081 NU33 "The Tarahumaras have not advanced very far in the art of medicine in spite of a great amount and variety of curing. Most of the cures are simple and require no special ability outside of ritual. The herb specialists, however, have some real empirical basis of knowledge. But even in their case the truly beneficial and the superstitious are inextricably entwined. My informant, Jesús, would speak with scorn of the hoax involved in the extraction of maggots but would highly recommend the carrying of a cane of cocolmeca as a cure for rheumatism in the arm. ... Medicinal cures have been maintained for a slightly different reason. Their use involves little of either significance or ritual. One learns them much as he acquires the names for trees and plants. Specialists have also made a practice of preserving this herb knowledge. Relationship terms survive while native personal names have disappeared. Secret names involving a special significance tend to die out."
t0100 cite0207 NU33 "The owerúame is a most necessary ceremonial figure in both the bautizado and gentile communities, and each family has one to which it appeals for its curing needs. The status is basically an achieved status, even though according to Tarahumara theory, the power is born in one. It is evident that considerable training in “medicines” and ritual is necessary. There are many differences in popularity and reputation among the various holders of curing powers. Many people claim to hold such power in one form or another, but only a few enjoy wide reputations and are sought from great distances. Female curers exist, but are rare."
t0100 cite0207 NU33 "In the development of an owerúame’s career and prestige three major stages may be abstracted. The initial stage usually begins in youth for those who feel “called.” Because a major part of curing and divining is done in dreams, a requisite qualification is imagination and a propensity for dreaming. Generally, the owerúame dreams of the person’s soul being in some kind of danger and he rescues it, thereby effecting the cure. A boy who dreams a great deal and is very imaginative likely begins to think of himself as having curative powers and will be encouraged in this. Seledonio of Inápuchi began his career at about age 15 when he received a warning from an angel in a vision. It threatened disaster if the people did not dance and sacrifice a white bull and a white chicken."
t0100 cite0207 NU33 "In addition to a perception of being “called,” the neophyte must learn the details of the various rituals. These are fairly simple, and the youth reporting such visionary experience is often given a subordinate ritual role under the tutelage of an owerúame . He may act as leader and flag bearer of the troop of boys who parade through the young corn in the annual field-curing ceremony, or he may assist in lightning prevention rituals."
t0100 cite0207 NU33 "In the second stage of his career the owerúame begins to perform some rituals alone, and sometimes receives invitations to cure the sick at nearby ranchos . When his supernatural activities become known in the immediate vicinity, his career development [Page 133] then depends upon opportunity, his sense of drama, manipulative skill, and success in those rituals he is called upon to perform. His opportunity comes sooner or later, since not only do the older practitioners eventually die, but often they must make long journeys to distant ranchos, and, therefore, are not available for emergencies in their own territory. On some occasions a small curing ceremony may not require a great owerúame, and this allows the neophyte (or owéame ) a chance to practice his ritual skills."
t0101 cite0084 NU33 "Calistro began recovering almost as soon as the bakánawi specialist finished, but over the summer he relapsed. By mid-August he could not walk without pain, had no appetite, and had lost a lot of weight. His in-laws tried to convince him to enter the Jesuit-run clinic in Creel, about fifty kilometers away, but Calistro was afraid he would die there. He finally agreed to go if the clinic staff could cure an old Rarámuri man from Rejogochi whom they were treating. The old man died in the clinic a few days later."
t0102 cite0084 NU33 "People in Rejogochi also occasionally use commercial drugs they buy from Chabochis. They consider these medicines to be particularly appropriate for curing the personified illnesses known as nawirí (most of which they consider to be minor) because both the nawirí and the medicines come from the Devil. They also recognize the competence of Chabochi doctors, both folk practitioners and licensed M.D.s, in treating minor ailments and injuries. The residents of Rejogochi frequently carry their babies to several local Mestizo women to have the babies’ fontanelles lifted, stating that these women are more adept at this procedure than are their Rarámuri counterparts. 43 They also take advantage of the medical services offered at nearby clinics and hospitals operated by the Jesuit missionaries and the Mexican government (Anzures y Bola[unknown]nos 1978). However, the Rarámuri maintain that Chabochi doctors cannot cure illnesses caused by soul loss or sorcery and thus see no point in calling upon them for those illnesses, except perhaps as a last resort."

t0105 cite0210 ND08 "Prior to the construction of the nursing station in 1972, childbirth took place either at the mother's home or at a hunting camp, with assistance provided by older and more knowledgeable women. Today the vast majority of women prefer to give birth at the nursing station rather than remain in Yellowknife for two to three weeks prior to the birth of the child. Generally, only women pregnant with their first child or those with a history of birth complications are encouraged to fly to Yellowknife where better obstetrical and neonatal care is available."

t0107 cite0212 NG06 "In addition to leadership roles in political affairs, women held other specialized status positions in Ojibway history. Among the medico-religious specialists, medicine women played a prominent role. They not only treated illness in general but served the special medical needs of other women, particularly at childbirth. Medicine women were not just midwives, as most adult women knew how to assist in labor. They were called in when complications arose and were paid for their services as specialists. Medicine women were also consulted by women who wished to induce abortion or prevent a miscarriage. In the latter case, one medicine woman mixed certain herbs with lint and had her patient stand over the smoldering mixture. Knowledge of this cure came “to my sister and me from my mother, and she received it from her grandmother…; Since no one but my sister and I have this knowledge, and we won't live much longer, it will die when we go; it belongs to our family.”"
t0108 cite0213 NG06 "There have always been occasional men and women who were single all their lives. They are simply called bachelors, with no judgments involved. The women, as they lived alone and had to support themselves, necessarily undertook such masculine activities as trapping, canoe-making, even hunting. The skilled ones were generally respected. One of the men, John Wilson's mother's brother, said he did not marry because he did not like women. No sex abnormalities were known of these people; indeed, the Emo people could not understand the description of the berdache."

The drugs brewed are very considerable in number; some are rare, and are imported at great price from other aboriginal localities. They are used to treat nearly every disorder, some of which are nose-bleed (which we have seen to be treated as well by the nanandawi' iwe), sex diseases, diarrhoea, lung bleeding, menstrual disturbances, womb troubles, constipation, etc. In some cases, treatment is realistic, in others the guardian spirit is invoked. The invocation is not necessary, and depends on individual temperament or on a special supernatural experience. But the knowledge of the prescriptions is always purchased, except between close relatives, and between the practitioner and his assistant. (In every realm, assistants acquire property by their services, no other payments being required.) Everyone knows some prescriptions. The more prominent herbalists at Manitou are: (men) the brothers Namepok, Kebegaba u, Kekekobin[unknown]s; their brother's son Dan Hawk; Sandy Horton; Billy M'Ginnis and his father's father, Chief Jack; Jack M'Ginnis 2nd; (women) Mrs. Bunyan, her daughter Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Chief George and her daughter Mrs. Jack M'Ginnis 2nd, Mrs. Charlie Speaker."
t0111 cite0214 NG06 "Women are the midwives of the Ojibwa. Men are excluded from a childbirth except for a certain brief magical performance which is resorted to in a desperate case. Midwifery is a highly skilled occupation, depending upon an extensive herbal knowledge, detailed knowledge of the female anatomy and physiology, varied massage techniques, and a cool and resourceful intelligence. This profession, too, is not open to all women but only to those who show marked aptitude and interest. Public recognition of a woman's ability is expressed by repeated requests for her services at confinements."
t0112 cite0214 NG06 "In the training of a girl, the lesser avoidance relatives are most important in developing her unconventionality, for they employ her as an assistant in their work. A girl who accompanies her father on a duck or moose hunt must learn all the cautions of the hunt except the actual shooting. Personal inclinations may then tip the scales [Page 137] of sex difference. ... If a man's only child is a daughter, it is almost a certainty that he will teach her the work of a man, at the same time that her mother will teach her the work of a woman. This was the case with Iron Woman, the daughter of a famous shaman. She was noted for her “supernatural” ability at all skilled activities: religious performances, games, hunting. Her father had taught her carefully, and had provoked her to prove her superiority over others. She was so interested she never thought of marrying and maintaining her own lodge; besides “she thought no man was good enough for her.” Her parents did not coax her to marry; they were interested chiefly in making her their companion in all that they knew and did."
t0112 cite0214 NG06 "Iron Woman practised as a shaman and, like a man was the victim of her own profession. (Continued sorcery acts like a boomerang upon the practitioner: after it has been sent out and has accomplished its mission, it returns to the home of its owner, and lying there as idle mischief, it causes the death of near relatives, usually young children). “She never cried in front of people when her children died, but she used to go back in the bush and cry. One time an old woman heard her crying and talking. ‘Oh, manito, what can I do to undo all the bad things I did when I was young, so that my children will be able to live?’ When she came back she gave her father a slap and said, ‘Yes, it is all your fault that I am in misery. You made me use all this medicine, you old devil!’ Her father did not answer her. But later he said, ‘Yes, my daughter, it is true that you will always suffer for that. That is why I always advised you never to marry. I will give you some medicine so that you will never have children again.’ And she said, ‘No, I'm going to have another child soon.’ They did everything in their power so that the child would live. She even went through the Grand Medicine ceremony for her unborn child. When her baby was born, they put it through the [Page 154] ceremony also, but it lived just a short time, and then it too died. Iron Woman had almost died when she was giving birth to the child, and her parents gave her medicine so that she would never have a child again. But she did not know this. After her baby died, she said that she did not want any more medicine (shamanistic ability), and she let go even her sucking doctor practise and her gambling. About three years later, when she did not have another child, she was angry. She knew that her father must have given her medicine to drink, and she gave him a good scolding. But after she let everything (shamanistic) go, she became a coward. She never went anywhere alone in the dark, or even in the daytime. Her husband always had to go with her, for she was so afraid. One night when her husband was out walking and she was alone, a woman came in and started to wrestle with her. She did not know who it was, and she was very frightened. The woman said, ‘You made a darn fool of me, and I'm here to square up with you.’ She could not get hold of this woman for it was the ghost of a woman from whose bones her father had scraped medicine. Of course she did not know it was a ghost. When her husband came in, the ghost disappeared. And she was afraid to stay alone. Some time after that when her husband was out, a man came in and started to wrestle with her as the woman had done. After that she used to faint as soon as they came in.” The deliberate abandonment of her established special lifeways, and the obsessive fears and remorse that preyed upon her resulted in a temporary breakdown during which she sent her husband away and wandered about in the woods waiting for death."
t0113 cite0215 NG06 "Gathering and selling snakeroot illustrates how the Anishinaabeg learned to integrate their traditional seasonal pursuits into the market economy. Herbal specialists among the Anishinaabeg had long recognized the medicinal properties of Seneca snakeroot ( Polygala senega L.), calling it bi'jikiwuck or “cattle medicine.” They made a decoction from it for coughs, colds, convulsions, and in combination with other plants for heart trouble, treated sore throats with an infusion from its leaves, [Page 81] and used it to destroy swallowed water bugs. American pharmacists also came to value snakeroot primarily as an expectorant and cough remedy, creating a market for it. Local merchants, like Sylem Fairbanks, advertised “Market Prices paid for Ginseng, Snake Root and Furs.” Indians obliged, gathering far more than they needed for their own medicinal needs. Wagoosh, a young man who was courting John Rogers's sister, introduced him to snakeroot, telling him that “the prices… are going to be high.” Once Rogers learned the technique of digging roots, there was no stopping him. Soon he and his brother “were bragging over our speed in pulling the snake root” and making it a “contest to see who would get the biggest root for his sack.” Wagoosh also taught Rogers's family how to market snakeroot by escorting his mother to town to exchange it for a “goodly supply of groceries.” After that, he and his family “dug snake root every day, making several trips to town with it—so we always had a good supply of edibles.” Snakeroot had become a significant source of income, and the Anishinaabeg learned how to get the best price for it. Some observers regarded collecting snakeroot and ginseng ( Panax quinquefolius L.) as a demeaning way to make a living. For the Anishinaabeg, however, it provided yet another source of income that was easily integrated into the seasonal round."
t0114 cite0216 NG06 "The origins of the Midewiwin ceremony have long been debated by scholars: some maintain that it was a post-contact development in Ojibwa culture, stimulated by certain features of European belief and organization. Aboriginal people maintain that it is much older than this, however, and recent re-assessment of the post-contact origin argument tends to support the Aboriginal view. 84 Certainly, by the late eighteenth century the ceremony was well established and played an important role in Ojibwa culture. The Midewiwin has been described by its practitioners as a life-giving ceremony: it was performed to cure serious illnesses, and its teachings helped the people to live properly so as to obtain success and health in life and to prepare for the afterlife. The Midewiwin ceremony included the retelling of Ojibwa history and origin stories, which contained lessons on the “right” [Page 24] way to live. Men and women who were initiated into the Midewiwin regarded themselves as relatives even if they came from different clans, families, and areas, and because of this the Midewiwin reinforced social ties among these groups and spread a common body of traditions to people who were usually isolated from each other."
t0115 cite0216 NG06 "These patterns of interaction reveal a relationship between the Ojibwa and the clergy that involved far more than simple manipulation. Communication within this relationship was always obscured by cross-cultural “static.” Each side, quite understandably, interpreted the other from within its own cultural framework, and there was an astounding lack of “fit” between the two cultural systems. The Ojibwa, for instance, likened the missionaries to their own religious specialists — shamans — and expected them to perform the same functions, including curing and the use of spiritual power to lend physical protection to vulnerable humans. They were thus disillusioned by the deaths of children sent to an early missionary school in Red River. The missionary was told that the Natives “think it is of no use to send you their children as you can no more keep them from dying than they can themselves.”"
t0116 cite0217 NG06 "There are only a few recognized “specialists” practicing blood-letting by the cupping method at the present time. The practitioners are usually women (bepe'šwe'jikwe, cutting or scratching woman), and there is no cult or supernatural practices connected with it. The knowledge and technique is taught to an apprentice for a fee, although one male informant claimed he was taught how to do it by a mosquito and horse-fly, through a dream. The patient pays the doctor a fee, usually tobacco and some common article, but one person charges a fee of $5.00 per treatment. The most common ailments treated in this manner are headaches and blood-poisoning, but such things as dizziness, soreness, swelling, and rheumatism are also regarded as curable by this technique."
t0116 cite0217 NG06 "The equipment consists of a sharp instrument for making the incision, and a section of horn to draw off the blood (Fig. 5). In several instances the lancet was obtained by smashing a coldcream jar and selecting a sharp fragment, but a knife or razor may be used, and one practitioner had a triangular steel blade set into a wooden handle. The cupper is made from a three- or four-inch section of the small end of a cow horn which is cleaned out and the tip perforated. To cure a headache, for example, the doctor makes a slanting incision in the temple of the patient so as to strike a vein, puts the large end of the horn over the cut, and sucks on the small end to draw off the blood which is caught in a dish. According to one informant the blood is caught in a dish containing water and emptied outside in an isolated spot “where no-one will step on it or disturb it.” Blood-letting is limited to the head and limbs, and for blood-poisoning the person is bled until “all the dark blood is out and the blood runs red and clear.” A pint seems to be about the maximum removed at any one time. No sterilization of the lancet is reported, but some doctors apply a native salve to the cut after the bleeding has stopped, or a native astringent may be used to stop the bleeding. When a metal lancet is used the point is placed over a vein [Page 194] and lightly snapped with the thumb and finger to make the cut. In some cases two or three treatments over a period of several weeks are necessary before a cure is effected. While blood-letting was not scientifically employed by the Chippewa, it undoubtedly effected cures in some instances. That blood-letting can have a salutary physiological effect is indicated by the fact that modern medical science makes considerable use of it in cases of hypertension and Polycythemia Vera. ..."
t0116 cite0217 NG06 "Another technique for curing the same ailments as by cupping is to strike repeatedly the ailing area of the patient with an instrument set with a series of needles. This method is practiced by individual specialists, mostly women, who work without supernatural assistance. The usual fee is a gift of tobacco often accompanied by such articles as blankets or beadwork. The tattooing instrument in former times was usually the upper or lower jaw of a garfish, of which the long rows of needle-like teeth served quite well. I obtained one such specimen in 1941, but it was the only one on the reservation to my knowledge (Fig. 6). The usual type today is a series of steel needles set into the end of a stick. The instrument is first dipped into a native medicine and the sore spot hammered on, and sometimes a poultice or medicine is applied afterward. Medicine is always used in conjunction with tattooing."
t0117 cite0218 NG06 "Bloodletting, now rarely practiced, was a traditional form of medical treatment among the Lake Winnipeg Saulteaux. It must be regarded as a strictly practical form of medicine; it was not associated with drumming, incantations, or other ritual activities. It involved specialists not necessarily associated with the Grand Medicine Society and there is evidence at Little Black River that the art was transmitted from father to son. A substantial knowledge of the circulatory system was required, and over 200 physiological terms were collected in 1965 (Steinbring 1965a)."
t0118 cite0089 NG06 "The Wabenos appealed to traditional manitos and recalled the aboriginal myths. Their ceremonies used dance and song as means of religious communication, but the rituals themselves were innovations. Visionaries played prominent roles in the founding of the movement and thus continued an essential aspect of the traditional religion, as did their concern for hunting and curing (Jenness 1935: 62–63). Their leaders, however, vied with the older specialists. And when hunting did not increase, the movement vanished, leaving unassociated Wabenos in undefined positions, serving no apparent religious function and falling increasingly under the accusations of witchcraft. As a movement the Wabeno complex lasted no longer than the early twentieth century."
t0119 cite0219 NM09 "Indian surgeons were apparently as successful with fractures and dislocations. However, Lafitau's assertion that they did not perform less well with ruptures and hernias and that broken bones mended in 8 days' times is questionable. The important fact historically is that [Page 513] these early medicine men undertook the same types of cures that are also attributed to their descendants, the present holders of the Little Water Medicine bundles. As specialists the latter profess some feats that were formerly performed quite commonly by hunters, among whom dislocations were more frequent than fractures."
t0119 cite0219 NM09 "If an Indian has dislocated his foot or knee, when hunting alone, he creeps to the next tree, and tying one end of his strap to it, fastens the other to the dislocated limb, and lying on his back, continues to pull it till it is reduced."
t0120 cite0220 NM09 "LAFITAU (IV. 79 ff.) presents an interesting essay on Indian medicine. It seems that there were two classes of practitioners, healing the one by art, and the other by science. The first class treated ailments by physical means, lotions, decoctions, steam-baths, etc. Many of their remedies were surprisingly efficacious, others operated rather by violence than by any special adaptation to the end. The herbs which they used were improved by being gathered at certain times and seasons, etc., and the general method of treating diseases was not unlike that of remote communities anywhere. Their surgery was clumsy, being performed only with flint instruments, and to the surprise of the French they used bleeding only for local congestions, not as the panacea it was in Europe. They could set broken bones, and in the cure of wounds were wonderfully successful. Lafitau describes the treatment, which consisted simply in keeping the wound clean and sheltering it from the air. The effects of this therapy seemed marvellous to Europeans."
t0121 cite0090 NM09 "When a somewhat more complicated disease develops, one has recourse to the known herbal specialists. These specialists--the stereotype depicts an “old woman,” although they may be of either sex-have become known for their general skill or perhaps for success in treating special diseases. One was known to be a specialist for bladder obstruction; another for piles and skin diseases; still others for tuberculosis and appendicitis. In each case the doctor had been known to produce successful cures. ..."
t0121 cite0090 NM09 "Medicine should be dispensed without charge to all those who have need of it and who ask for it. Obviously, this is not a satisfactory arrangement for the herbal specialists, and payment is now expected either in money or goods or by an exchange of herbs, although most of them affect a show of reluctance when payment is offered. When a medicine is given to a patient, the herbalist always includes instructions concerning its use, and in case of severe illness he may even supervise the treatment. ... The medicines used are mainly herbal preparations, sometimes prepared by specialists and sometimes simply prepared privately."
t0121 cite0090 NM09 "The boundary between the natural herbal preparations and the more magical ones is often indistinct. The more sophisticated herbal specialists say that their medicines contain ingredients which have great power and which can be procured only under special circumstances. An example is the remedy for “summer complaint” (intestinal flu) called onrahs?ago[unknown] wa (“large rooster comb”), which is a pine-tree fungus. This medicine “calls one with a clucking noise high from a pine tree,” and in order to be an effective agent it must be shot. Furthermore, it must be shot immediately, else it will “run and hide,” and, therefore, it is very scarce. After being shot, it is detached from the tree, dried, and given as a powder in a cup of water. This medicine seems to “holler” after having been administered, just as when it was found, for when the writer took a dose, all three people who knew about it independently heard it “holler” at night in the tree outside their house, although the tree was not a pine but a maple. Also, it is said to presage a death in the family by “hollering” in its storage container. Knowledge and use of this type of medicinal agent--seminaturalistic, semimagical--usually qualifies its dispenser to be called “a real doctor,” with the implication that the preparations are slightly tinged with the magical, but not as seriously as witch medicines or hunting-charm medicines. Since such medicines are dispensed rather secretly, and since a certain amount of esoteric knowledge is involved in their preparation, it is not difficult to see how suspicion of witchcraft might be attached to the herbalist. It is also not [Page 267] inconceivable that these herbalists do at times allow themselves to become implicated, perhaps unwittingly, in the preparation of witchcraft or counter-witchcraft. A basic maxim for the Iroquois might be: “whoever is close to Indian medicine is close to witchcraft.”"
t0122 cite0090 NM09 "Yet another example [of adopting ""white man's medicine""] is that of one of the most erudite of the practicing herbal specialists, who is always intensely interested in the descriptions and uses of “white medicine,” and in addition to buying and prescribing them outright, has used many of them as ingredients in her “traditional” mixtures. Another herbalist, who at the age of ninety was still the “spring tonic” specialist of the Reserve, was said to include “store” items in her preparation, whose composition she learned from “the old people.” Thus there is evidence that the incorporation of medicines and herbs procured in the neighboring pharmacies has a long history at Six Nations."
t0123 cite0090 NM09 "The only prerequisite for either a man or a woman to practice fortunetelling is the elusive one of being properly endowed by the Great Creator. A strong indication of this endowment, though by no means a necessary one, is to be born with a caul. Ideally, there are some disqualifications. Chiefs, preachers, and Longhouse speakers ought not engage in fortunetelling, but in the real culture this is ignored. It is not at all clear how the practicing fortunetellers become aware of their own powers, but it is unlikely that a normal member of the conservative community would practice without conviction, for there are strong warnings against such presumption. A reflection of these warnings is found in the Code (Parker, 1913: 49-50), which relates that when Handsome Lake was asked to divine on behalf of his halfniece, he protested that he had not yet been so empowered by the messengers. He was, however, persuaded to tell fortunes against his will and against the will of the Angels. At Six Nations it is said that “the people bossed him into fortunetelling, else they could not have feasts.” The warnings against unauthorized fortunetelling are reinforced by a general fear of improper contact with medicines and supernatural agencies, which are characterized as being “too dangerous to fool around with.” Although the ability to tell fortunes is considered to be a gift of the Creator, the details of the art are often supposed to be learned from older practitioners, and skill can be increased by “practicing” (in analogy to ritual speaking or singing). ..."
t0123 cite0090 NM09 "The fortunetellers tend to prescribe standard cures for a few characteristic symptoms. Among these are False Face Dances for facial paralysis, Red False Face rites for nose bleeding, Otter rites for sore, red eyes, Bear Dance for hysterical spitting or clambering along the wall, formation of a ritual friendship for “lonely” children, snow-snake or ball games for sore legs, and Little Water Medicine for internal injuries and broken bones. However, the body of specific Indian cures for specific ailments is quite limited today, contrary to some of the reports in the literature (e.g., Speck, 1949: 59), and there is considerable latitude even within the standardized part of medical lore. Each consultation with a fortuneteller is a unique case, for not only is the method of diagnosis at the discretion of the fortuneteller, but he is free to vary the standard prescription because of the particular circumstances of the patient and his complaint. Thus fortunetelling is an individualistic activity which may be properly characterized as an art, and each practitioner has his own style."
t0124 cite0130 NM09 "Another factor to consider with respect to the continuance of traditional Iroquois medicine is the effect of Christianity. The fact that the Christian Iroquois in one Grand River settlement in 1798 did not actively participate in a Longhouse feast intended to ward off sickness, among other things, has already been noted. Adherence to Christianity, at least ideally, might eliminate recourse to medicine societies and other ceremonies connected with curing in the Longhouse, such as the forming of ritual friendships and the holding of curative feasts. The effects of Christianity upon the more pragmatic aspect of Iroquois medicine--herbal remedies--would appear to have been less immediate, as the use of plants believed to have medicinal properties, always less extensive than among the Longhouse Iroquois, was retained among Christian families until the early 1900's. The practice was probably retained because although certain beliefs and rituals accompanied the collection and administration of herbs by a specialist, these did not necessarily apply for the ordinary individual. Thus an individual could continue relying on or simply sporadically using herbs without necessarily having an ideological commitment to the Longhouse faith."
t0125 cite0093 NA12 "Almost all of the information on childbirth was obtained from a professional native midwife. She delivered [Page [p.501-a]] her first child when she was only 13 years old, following the instructions of her mother, and by 1954 (age 60) had successfully delivered over 40 babies. In the old days, the midwife and her assistants were supposed to be gUnEtkAna[unknown]yi—members of the opposite moiety, women either of the patient’s father’s sib or of her husband’s sib. Actually, any woman or girl would be expected to help in an emergency, and the most skilled would naturally be called. However, the women who were close relatives in the opposite moiety were supposed to do what they could to help the mother and the new baby."
t0126 cite0221 NA12 "On other occasions a powerful group might decide to remain in the community and the weaker victim group or individual might be unable to receive a just settlement. In this case the hostility fell outside the normal peace making structure that dealt mainly with interclan disputes. In intraclan situations hostilities, jealousy, or envy left unchecked might fester within the mind of an individual until revenge became the dominant motive in life. In such cases witchcraft provided an alternative course of action. Through witchcraft a person could seek mystical power to revenge another individual who had caused the first person to be hurt in some way in the past. A witch attempted to destroy social good will. The actions of the lier, thief, or the adulterer also posed a direct threat against group solidarity and their behavior was difficult to explain. The practitioner of witchcraft and the incestuous individual were both consigned as evil doers who were believed to be in league with evil powers or else such deeds would not have been perpetuated according to Native belief. Both elements lay beyond the normal political processes of the crest group. Therefore, an Indian doctor from another clan, who could not be blinded by the power of witchcraft from within the group, was called in to detect the witch and to force a cancellation of the spell. To resolve the conflict close relatives of the practitioner were expected to administer the punishment in order to absolve the community of the problem, to avoid retaliation, and restore the community to normalcy."
t0127 cite0094 NF06 "Faint-hearted lovers, or more aggressive ones whose advances were repulsed by the girls of their choice, sometimes employed love medicines to bring them success in their amorous endeavors. These were secret formulae concocted by specialists for a fee. Because the Cree Indians were famous for these medicines, the Blackfeet referred to love medicine as “Cree Medicine.” There were many varieties. One such medicine called for making two little birch bark images, one representing a man and the other a woman. A stick was dipped in the liquid medicine, then touched to the hearts of the male and female figures. This magic was certain to make the girl long for the company of her as yet unsuccessful lover. So powerful were love medicines reputed to be that resistance to them was considered useless."

t0129 cite0222 NF06 "Other owners called in a horse medicine man or a specialist in the treatment of broken bones. Bear-Goes-East, a Piegan of the Blood band, was remembered as a well-known specialist. He was credited with the power to heal broken bones of animals or humans, by rubbing them with mud. The horse owner paid him well, sometimes another [Page 50] horse, for his services. Bear-Goes-East was considered a powerful doctor, but not a horse medicine man. Lazy Boy recalled that once, while on a war party, Bear-Goes-East’s partner fell over a cliff and broke his leg. The Crow Indians were chasing them. Bear-Goes-East collected some mud from a nearby lake, applied it to his partner’s leg, and “healed it right there.”"
t0130 cite0222 NF06 "In buffalo days if a horse suffered from an illness the owner was unable to diagnose, he might load a musket with powder only and fire it at the side of the horse. The horse might get well. 27 If the owner was wealthy or the horse was a valuable buffalo runner or racer the Blackfoot owner generally preferred to take no chances. He called upon one of the powerful horse medicine men to treat his mount. The horse medicine man was paid well for his services. (See pp. 270-271.)"
t0131 cite0223 NF06 "It was also considered desirable to limit the number of children. Two years was the standard interval, but the longer the time between siblings, the more parents demonstrated their love for the child previously born. Moreover, abortion carried no stigma. Magic help for this purpose could be easily secured from an authorized female practitioner, and as a special favor, a stop could be put to childbearing altogether. Revealingly, barrenness is never given as a cause for divorce in this competitive society where women are highly prized as property and sex objects, and where marriage is notoriously unstable."
t0132 cite0224 NF06 "In competition with the hospital are a number of medical practitioners who earn fees from their services. These persons are usually specialists for swellings, blood poisoning, female complaints, etc., and nearly every cluster of houses can produce at least one such practitioner. The income derived from this source is, however, usually small, so that this knowledge is no guarantee of an abundant life. A shirt or a blanket is a typical gift from the patient, or in the case of a spectacular and painstaking cure, a piece of furniture or a horse."

For a suitable return the service of one of these specialists could be obtained."
t0134 cite0095 NF06 "The Blackfeet have a superstition that a doctor should not relate his dreams (sources of inspiration), nor reveal his methods, nor hand them down to others. On the other hand, leaders of religious ceremonials were expected to teach their rituals to anyone who made a vow to purchase them. Sometimes a doctor was a specialist, his power being confined, by the command received in his dream, to a certain form of sickness."
t0134 cite0095 NF06 "Because the presence of spectators is believed to weaken the doctor’s power, even the patient’s family [Page 248] are ordinarily excluded from the ceremony. As I had never been permitted to witness a medicine man’s methods of doctoring, I fully expected to be asked to withdraw. To my surprise, Awunna called upon me to assist in the incantations, saying that if I would join in the chants it would give him greater power in his doctoring. I consented, but asked for permission to photograph the ceremonial during his visit on the following morning. Awunna hesitated and Ekitowaki, his wife, at once raised objections, but it was decided in my favour by the patient himself, who requested that the pictures be taken, so that I could explain to the white people the Blackfeet methods of doctoring."
t0135 cite0095 NF06 "“For many years I have helped to support my family by catching eagles. I dispose of most of the feathers among the South Piegans, who use them for their headdresses and medicine bonnets. It is very difficult and exhausting work to take eagles alive. When I was a young man my father taught me his methods, for he was a skilled eagle-catcher. I camp in an unfrequented place, near the foot of the mountains. After digging a deep hole, so that I can stand erect inside, I kill a coyote and stretch the tanned hide on sticks, with raw meat laid along the sides, as if it had just been cut open. Long before sunrise, I enter the hole, covering the top over with branches and leaves. The coyote bait lies on top, just over my head. I must stand in the hole all day, not able to eat, nor drink, nor even smoke, lest the eagles scent the smoke. All day long I chant the coyote medicine song, ‘I want the eagles to eat my body.’"
t0135 cite0095 NF06 "The power of this song draws the eagles towards the bait. First I see the Mami-as-ich-imi (Long Tails or Magpies) coming. They walk around chattering [Page 429] and talking, saying to each other over and over again, ‘Magpies go on ahead, and hang your sack upon a tree.’ An eagle sees the Longtails feasting, and swoops down beside the bait. He first walks suspiciously around and around the coyote, and at last steps over upon the branches and begins to eat. I then push my hands through the branches and, grasping him firmly, first by one leg and then by the other, I pull him quickly down into the hole, and kill him by breaking his back with my foot. In this way the wings fall to either side, and the feathers are uninjured. After sunset, my wife comes to the pit with food. She uncovers the top and helps me out. I desire most to catch the Peta (Golden Eagle), because its feathers are the most valuable. Its head and breast are light brown, with white beneath the wings. Its tail feathers are also white, with black tips. We never use Black Eagles, and White Heads (Bald Eagles) are very scarce, as well as dangerous. They are so strong, they have almost lifted me out of the pit."
t0135 cite0095 NF06 "“In former days, when grizzly bears were plentiful, eagle-catching was very dangerous. I remember one Indian, who was in his pit, when a big grizzly came to the bait, and started to drag it away. The man foolishly held to his bait, and the bear turned to investigate. He scratched off the branches and, seeing a man in the hole, dragged him out and, in a rage, tore him to pieces. His friends found nothing but his bones. There are now so many white men in the country, it is difficult to find a locality wild enough to catch eagles. At present I go to a place on the other side of the Porcupine Mountains.”"
t0135 cite0095 NF06 "Pointing towards the north, Brings-down-the-Sun said: “You can see from here the highest peak of the Porcupine Mountains. It is surrounded by a thick [Page 430] forest and no trail leads to that peak. Its summit is precipitous and covered with scrub pines. You will notice that our most severe storms come from the direction of that peak. When my eldest son died, I felt his loss so deeply, that I climbed to its summit and lay there fasting, for ten days and ten nights. During that time I had a dream, in which the Spirit of the Mountain appeared and gave me a Medicine Robe with a song. He instructed me how to make the robe, and said that, if I used it in doctoring, or when I appeared before the assembled people, I would be endowed with wisdom and supernatural power."
t0136 cite0225 NT09 "Prestige.—Don was born in March, 1890, into the Sun clan. He had a five-year-old sister, Gladys, and a two-year-old brother, Ira, who was still nursing. 4 Not only was Don at pains, fifty years later, to tell the signs which had portended greatness for him, but he had been considerably preoccupied with the idea of his own importance early in his childhood. Don's mother, when she was pregnant, had been told that she was carrying twins, but a medicine man succeeded in bringing the two babies together into one, 5 Don believes. “My mother also helped to bring us [twins] together by her strong wish for only one baby” (58, p. 25). 6 After his birth, his relatives could tell from his double hair-whorls that indeed he had been twins that had united into one baby. This was considered a sign that, even as a child, he was capable of exercising the healer's art, and that he would develop into an expert in hunting, herding, and curing. His parents tried to impress him with this view of the future as soon as he could understand them. Very early his behavior showed that he had remarkable “antelope power,” an attribute of twins. His feelings of possessing unusual qualities were fostered by his beloved maternal grandfather, who took or pretended to take Don's claims to power very seriously (58, pp. 40–41). Don was his favorite grandchild. He taught Don healing techniques which permitted him to validate himself as an important child. Don could cure people who had trouble urinating, by massaging them in the area of the groin. Although there was danger that a patient might die, Don felt that he could distinguish those who were fatally ill and refused to treat them. These powers, in his childhood, earned him prestige with his parents, with the people of Oraibi, and particularly with his grandfather. They even compensated for his poor ability as a runner. But his grandfather [Page 30] pointed out not only the possibilities but also the limitations of Don's future career. The old man said that Don's power would fade before he grew up. He could never be a good healer in adult life, since he was not a member of the Badger or the Snake clan, whose members made the best doctors. He might, however, become an important leader and a special officer in the ceremonies. Nevertheless, Don always hoped that his ceremonial father would take him into his own important societies—Wowochim, Fire, and Snake—and was once told that he might later be chosen to enter the Snake society. (The wish to enter the Snake society ran all through Don's childhood and youth. One motivation was presumably the wish to become a healer.) Don also points out that, on his mother's side, he had important relatives in the village 7 —men who showed a great deal of interest in him—and that he was related to the future Village chief, Tewaquaptewa."
t0137 cite0226 NT09 "In love magic an individual or generalized bait object is used, but no bait receptacle is employed. Either an expert wizard or a layman may perform love magic. The love sorcerer in both cases is termed Dï′SGi avu'. A layman who ardently desires a certain girl steals some of her hair, her saliva (Dï′DZ'va˙la), a piece of her shawl, or some threads from her woven [Page 8] belt. These objects together with a prayer feather he ties up in a package. He prays that the girl will desire him and puts the package in his pocket or under his belt (formerly, inside the waist band of his breech cloth). The girl becomes “on fire under her navel” and as long as he carries the package she visits him every night. “This love magic is dangerous. The girl and the man may go mad with love and kill themselves.” The bait objects are disposed of by burial when the man becomes tired of the girl: he makes a new package if he desires another mistress."
t0137 cite0226 NT09 "The expert love magician works with a special Dï′sGiaf DixBo′ne, “love sorcerer's medicine bundle.” A man who desires a certain girl goes to the sorcerer and asks his help. The wizard gets out his DixBo′ne."
t0137 cite0226 NT09 "In carrying out his love magic the wizard holds the DixBo′ne in front of him and sings songs to it, joining the name of the man to the name of the girl. This excites the girl and she soon comes to the man's bed. The wizard who is hired in this way is recompensed by the gift of the man's sister or other female relative as his mistress for as long as he wishes. Some experts may use the DixBo′ne on their own account, in which case they become irresistible to all women in the village. Informant mentioned the name of an individual who was an exceedingly successful love expert on his own account."
t0137 cite0226 NT09 "More within the realm of folk belief is the work of the sorcerer who overcomes the resistance of recalcitrant young people by removing their hearts when they are asleep and hiding these in a jar. Such young people join the sorcerers' meetings and allow the latter freely to amuse themselves with their youthful bodies. The young people become sick. The medicine man treating such a case must find and restore the heart of the sick person before a cure is effective. Women as well as men may be love experts or practice the layman's love magic. One woman mentioned by informants is reputed to have become rich through gifts made her by men she has attracted to her bed."
t0138 cite0226 NT09 "When the position of the embryo within the womb becomes distorted and causes pain to the mother, she consults a medicine man who skillfully and painlessly pushes it back into its correct place. All of the women I spoke to had received this treatment at various times, some even two or three times during one pregnancy. No medicine man (Dï˙hi'G ia') in either of these villages is peculiarly a specialist in obstetrics. The one most often consulted at the present time is a highly thought of “bone doctor.” Another who is rapidly gaining fame as an obstetrician, is one who, without previous training or other equipment, recently entered the profession. He caused considerable anxiety to a young girl who knew she was pregnant by telling her that in point of fact, her womb harbored a growing tumor and that she would never be able to produce offspring to carry on the name of [Page 28] her clan. His opinion was over-ruled by government medical specialists, but the outcome of the pregnancy is not known to me. There is no bargaining over payment for the service of the native specialist, nor is there in fact, institutionalized payment. He is given a gift of corn meal or whatever else is handy if and when his client feels so inclined. His attitude is one of public spiritedness in the highest degree. 1 On one occasion a medicine man dropped his agricultural and herding activities for several days to stay day and night in the home of a parturient mother. Her labor was both long and painful. Added to this, she was frightened by the fact that two women had recently died in childbirth. The patient service of the medicine man was indeed appreciated, though no special attention was paid him."
t0139 cite0227 NT09 "Much of the curing of illness is done by the ceremonial societies, each of which appears to specialize in the cure of specific disease or illness, through the agency of the ranking chiefs or priests of the society in question. Payment for cures thus effected consists in joining the appropriate society or else providing a feast for the next society ritual performance. There are today, however, and probably were also in the past, medical specialists not, I think, affiliated with the curing societies. They make a practice of diagnosing and treating various ailments ranging, in typical cases, from over-due childbirth to persistent ulcers on the leg or acute stomach trouble. When such an expert is called, the practice at Second Mesa is for the patient, should he feel inclined, to repay the expert's attention by a gift of food at some indefinite future date, though should the illness be serious and the cure properly appreciated by the patient, a gift of food will immediately be made to the medicine man. ... In any case the pattern of payment seems to vary slightly at First Mesa where, according to Stephen, a preliminary gift of nominal value, usually a few yards of cloth, is always made before consultation takes place and is followed by more substantial gifts of food and materials after treatment is finished. At Second as at First Mesa, however, the pattern is to assume indifference as to the size of the gifts and to accept whatever is offered with no overt comment other than the conventional word of thanks. Though specialists called in from another mesa receive no special payments, it is not uncommon for a Hopi expert to travel long distances to treat a sick Navaho and to receive large fees for the extra trouble involved in such consultations. It may be noticed in this connection that a specialist in sorcery, BOWa˙'[unknown]a, might be hired to cause illness or death in a third individual and would be paid with turquoise, beads or a woman's dress for his services. A love sorcerer, Dï˙sGiavu'', engaged by a man to turn the affections of a girl [Page 22] in a definite direction, would be paid with similar goods, or in lieu of these, the man would give the sorcerer his own sister or other female relative to act as his mistress for as long as the sorcerer desired her."
t0139 cite0227 NT09 "2 A curing society, now died out at Second Mesa, which held public kiva ceremonies to exorcise witch-craft, though individual society members practiced private curing. Initiates chose as their ceremonial godfather either the eagle or the field mouse."
t0140 cite0228 NT09 "A mother should not attempt to treat the sick baby herself, although a few mothers do so. If the mother is dissatisfied with the treatment of the medicine man first called, she should not go to a second practitioner until four days have elapsed, but here, as elsewhere, practice does not conform to theory, and an anxious mother may call several medicine men in rapid succession. In severe cases the parents may promise that if he recovers the child will be given, as a member, to one of the societies. As a last resort, they may call the government nurse or the government doctor."
t0141 cite0229 NT09 "Martin regards Edna as a complete medicine woman. He said that she certainly was a regular “doctor” and not merely a [Page 246] stomach specialist. She had once cured him of sore eyes by the simple expedient of bathing them with clean water."
t0142 cite0230 NT09 "So many were the tricks they performed, there was no telling what they would do next. Soon the practitioners or medicine men began to exercise the Ya Ya powers for their own selfish and often evil purposes, and people began to be afraid of them. Then again they were afflicted with the disease of the eyes, and were asked to leave Oraibi. It is said they took all the fetishes representing their animals to seal up in a cave in the cliffs west of Oraibi. Here the fetishes still remain."
t0143 cite0231 OJ29 "Ekigei wegii, “to perform surgery with a flint knife .” Kapauku surgeons are skilled at extracting arrows from battle wounds and at making incisions with a flint knife ( ekigei ), either in, or near the wound, in order to let out the infected blood. While charging only 5 b if the patient survives, they collect 60 b in case of his death. The increased charge in the latter situation is due to the Kapauku conviction that they [Page 326] must compensate the surgeon for his suffering over his client’s death, and for the danger he faces of a possible attack by the evil spirit who killed the man he tried to save. Because Botukebo lacks a surgeon, all cases requiring surgical attention are referred to skilled practitioners in the allied villages of Jagauwauii, Aigii, and Bunauwobado. During the investigated eight months only two surgical operations were performed, costing Botukebo residents 10 b . It is obvious from the sum that both patients survived."
t0144 cite0231 OJ29 "Bukwakaa ego duwai, “to cut the gum,” and ego badii, “to extract teeth.” Kapauku dentists fall into two categories—the gum cutters and the extractionists. The gum cutters cure a toothache by incising the gum with a bamboo knife, thus removing the pressure of the abscess. For such a service there is usually no charge. Ijaaj Jikiiwiijaaj (3/2) is the expert of this art in Botukebo. An extractionist, on the other hand, usually requires a payment of 5 b per operation, provided the patient did not bite him. Such an accident easily happens because the practitioner uses his fingers as instruments. Should the patient misbehave and hurt the dentist, the fee is doubled. Unfortunately, Botukebo cannot boast of an extractionist; the nearest one lives in Aigii. During the eight-month period of 1955, no Botukebo residents had recourse to this specialist."
t0145 cite0102 OJ29 "The setting sun is a sign to stop the fighting. Both rival armies perform a “ waita tai, a counterclockwise circular dance,” and leave for their homes in the same fashion as they arrived at the battlefield—women in front, on the flanks and in the rear, and men in the middle. The wounded people are carried back to their villages on the shoulders of their fellow warriors. There, a skilled surgeon extracts the projectiles and makes an incision with a flint flake near the wound in order to let out the blood. This is also the time for the shaman to perform curative magic on wounded men and preventive magic for the healthy people. The dead are tied by their hands and feet to a pole and carried to the village where they are placed on a platform with the arrows left in their bodies. No war prisoners are taken. Instead, all the enemy are killed on the spot."
t0146 cite0102 OJ29 "There are a few other specialists, besides the traders, who sell their services to people. The shaman’s and sorcerer’s professions have already been discussed. In addition to these, there are expert surgeons who are skilled at taking out arrows from a wound and at making an incision with a flint knife, either in the wound or nearby, to let out the infected blood. If one survives, one pays only five beads for the best treatment. Since one’s eventual death is believed never to be related to the surgeon’s lack of skill but rather to an attack by an evil spirit, the surgeon charges the mourning heirs sixty beads instead of the normal small amount. The difference in price is paid because the doctor suffers by being sorry about the death of one he so eagerly tried to save. Dentists classify themselves in two categories: gum cutters, who save the teeth by incising the gum with a bamboo knife thus relieving the pressure, and extractionists. The writer watched an operation performed by a gum cutter on a patient who had suffered for seven days and whose pain could not be relieved by aspirin supplied by the writer. The patient became well in one day after a single incision. In more serious cases, the patient has to make an appointment with the extractionist. These specialists are rigorous in their business and are offended if one pleads with them to save the tooth. “You just go [Page 129] to Jikiiwiijaaj with this kind of work, I will not do it,” was the angry reply by an extractionist from Aigii to a man who asked only to have his gum incised. An extractionist cuts open the gum with a bamboo knife and extracts the tooth with his fingers. Two helpers hold the patient’s head while he is lying on his back during the operation. If it hurts severely, the dentist may give one “anesthesia” by kneeling on one’s stomach. This miraculously distracts one’s attention, holds down the body, stops the patient from hollering by forcing the air out of his lungs, opens his mouth, and permits the “doctor” to complete his task undisturbed. While for gum cutting the dentist does not charge at all, one has to pay five beads for an extraction. The fee may be doubled if one has bitten the practitioner."
t0147 cite0232 OJ29 "The most frequent and the most important types of white magical rites are those concerned with curing disease. After a man has been “attacked by an evil spirit which tries to remove his soul” he turns for help to a shaman. The practitioner, applying all his skill and knowledge, tries to expel the evil spirit from the body of the patient either by bribing it or by forcing it out with the help of his own guardian spirit. Almost every magical cure that I have witnessed differed from the others in individual selection of the elements of the magical rites, over-all organization of the procedure, sequence of the technique, and wording of the particular spells. The shamans also differ in their eloquence and their knowledge of lore and the use of the various paraphernalia. However, they all make use of certain elements of magical performance that are the property of the profession. Some of the most frequently used and, therefore, important elements of curative magic follow. Every magical procedure that I have observed started with a prayer by the shaman to the sun and moon Creator and to the shaman’s guardian spirits. During the performance that follows, a shaman invariably uses a magically powerful plant. Its selection often depends on the diagnosis of the cause of the disease. As a rule the evil spirits are associated with particular plants. However, the most generally used plant, often utilized next to that which a particular spirit requires, is the [Page 81] green variety of the ti plant. Its stem, with a few leaves left at its end, is a repellent of most of the evil spirits. The shaman carries it around his patient, touches the head and other parts of the body with it, shakes it furiously, and thus expels the spirit that causes the disease. Very often the plants are used together with glowing embers. The whole bundle, consisting of both ingredients, is moved counterclockwise, followed immediately by clockwise circles, around the patient’s head. This performance is almost always accompanied by involved, repetitive spells, uttered rapidly by the shaman, and by his spitting on the embers as well as around the patient. Since water is believed to have a purifying force the shaman and the sick man apply it freely to different parts of their bodies. The spirits are almost always bribed by the plants and glowing embers —augmented by sacrificial small birds, rats, or intestines of some larger animals—into leaving the body of the patient. Toward the end of the rite these offerings are hung on a pole, or thrown behind the shaman into the bush. The procedure may be combined with performances during which a shaman extracts, by sleight of hand, an evil object from the patient’s body. The practitioner may also try to recapture the patient’s soul on the end of the ti plant broom and reintroduce it into the sick man’s body. The magician’s trance, as well as his dreams, may also be employed in the cure. Through these the shaman claims to have learned the cause of the illness as well as the remedy for it. At the end of a magical ceremony he suggests some special observances that the patient must follow as a continuation of his cure. For a period of time, or for the rest of his life, he may be ordered to refrain from eating certain species of food plants or animals. As condition for a complete recovery the patient may be requested to manifest his generosity. This consists usually of killing a pig and distributing its meat free to the public. Sometimes he may also be asked to set aside a certain quantity of cowries for his son’s inheritance."
t0148 cite0233 OL06 "Gomaya was a case in point. The five sons of To'uluwa and Kadamwasila were all pleasant and clever, attractive and enterprising, and were all renowned for their love magic. As a matter of fact, the first and last of the formula here given I received from Yobukwa'u who, knowing only two out of the four charms, yet achieved an incestuous love-affair with his father's youngest wife, several adulteries, and two engagements one after the other. All these affairs were attributed to love magic; as was the case with Kalogusa, his younger brother, who subdued Yobukwa'u's fiancée, Isepuna. Another of the five brothers, Gilayviyaka, with whose intrigues too we are already acquainted, was also reputed to be an expert at love magic. Many more examples could be adduced, but it is better to keep to the more notorious cases."
t0148 cite0233 OL06 "Bagido'u, the nephew and heir-apparent of the principal chief, an extremely intelligent and pleasant informant, was ill of some internal wasting sickness, probably tuberculosis. We have already heard of his domestic [Page 377] mishaps, the defection of his handsome wife, who left him in order to join her late sister's husband, Manimuwa, a young, healthy and handsome man of Wakayse (see ch. vi, sec. I). She often visited her sister, and during the latter's last illness she stayed for a long time with her brother-in-law. The issue was obvious: Manimuwa and Dakiya formed an attachment and entered upon an illicit intrigue, which ended in her joining him. Magic was blamed for all the trouble. Even Bagido'u himself, the deserted husband, would say that she was a good woman, but that this bad man had first performed evil magic to estrange her from her husband, and afterwards love magic to seduce her. Dakiya, in fact, was quoted as the classical instance of the power of magic. “Magic made the mind of Dakiya; Manimuwa only remains in her mind.” The comic side of this otherwise sad story was that Bagido'u had the reputation of being the greatest expert in the magic of love. Of course, my informants were ready with explanations of the theoretical conundrums involved."
t0149 cite0234 OL06 "Mr Bellamy says; 'Children are desired, especially boy children. A barren woman is not perhaps despised, but in the event of a quarrel with another woman, her childlessness might be ""thrown in her face"" as a reproach. A megua tau (medicine man) is occasionally called in to ""doctor"" the bareness; his mode of procedure is incantation and a harmless drink a decoction of some native root' 1"
t0149 cite0234 OL06 "'A megua tau differs for a tobwagaru, although sometimes the professions are combined in the same individual. Tobwagaw is a sorcerer whose help is obtained and paid for to get rid of an enemy, why a megua tau medicines people, dogs, gardens, canoes, winds, weather and so forth' [The megua tau is in fact an expert practicing beneficent magic.]"
t0150 cite0104 OL06 "Of course, the spell may fail. The words may not have been strong enough, and the lover may seek another expert who has access to spells thought to be even more powerful. In some cases, because the expert was not paid enough, he or she deliberately may not have chanted the words for the necessary length of time. Trobrianders believe that the agent carrying the magic only becomes effective when the words are chanted again and again throughout the night or for several days so that the betel nut or tobacco absorbs its power from the act of speech itself. 7 Therefore, additional payments finally may produce success. Yet counters to this magic exist: For example, when a woman (or a man) finds herself totally lost in her longings for the man who wants her, a relative who knows an equally powerful magic spell may be able to remove the debilitating effects of the original spell. Even under the best circumstances, however, a suspecting woman simply may refuse the betel nut and remain free to choose someone else. In the final analysis, even the most formidable love magic can be averted, making love relationships as full of chance as any other relationship."
t0151 cite0235 OR19 "A whole succession of natives, especially old women, understand massaging (roa) very well. Massaging is done to set dislocated joints, to draw sores to a head, for stomach-aches, rheumatism, and asthma. The persons who do the massaging rub their hands with oil, in part out of consideration for the patient, in part for the sake of their own hands. Then they begin to massage, sometimes with the palm of the hand, sometimes with the fingertips, sometimes tenderly, sometimes firmly. The asthma patients have to sit down, and the medical practitioner rubs their backs vigorously from top to bottom with both hands. One day a ripe coconut fell from a palm and heavily grazed the head of a woman passing by. A man immediately rushed up, massaged her head, and pressed it together so that “the sutures do not come apart.”"
t0151 cite0235 OR19 "The massaging is done according to very definite rules and is not familiar to everybody. Good masseurs are popular and many an old man has married an equally old woman because she was a good masseuse. Out of all the medical knowledge of the Truk people the roa is the only thing that is sensible and useful."
t0152 cite0235 OR19 "In times of war it often happened that a hole would be made in a native’s forehead or some other part of the head by a skillful stone slinger. It is said that on the islands then there were a number of medical practitioners who were able to construct an artificial closure. They took a piece of coconut shell, scraped, cleaned, and fitted it into the hole, and let the skin grow over it. I was told this on various islands, also by people who claimed to have been eyewitnesses."
t0152 cite0235 OR19 "There are hundreds of experts in medicine (sousafei) who are ready to cure all kinds of suffering for a good payment on all the Truk Islands. One sousafei understands this medicine, another one that one. Now these medicines have nothing to do with the actual nature of the ailment. They are only supposed to paralyze the evil influence of the spirits. The pue must find out which spirit has bitten the patient, and furthermore the medicine which should be applied, as well as the house into which the patient should be put. If the disease does not subside, the patient is carried somewhere else, and another medicine is tried. Many a patient who is conveyed over mountain and valley on a stretcher or to other islands on a canoe is taken to his death during this."
t0152 cite0235 OR19 "Everything possible is used for the preparation of medicines: plants, tree roots, earth, and the like, and, what is more, in any given case those selected have a certain similarity to the illness in question."
t0153 cite0105 OR19 "The fourth important valuable is not an object at all but rather a form of incorporeal property known as magic or special knowledge. As we shall see in Chapter X, there are types of special knowledge relating to medicine and curing, house and canoe construction, navigation, sorcery, divination, and fighting. In general, only older people have special knowledge. A person does not usually begin studying it until [Page 61] he has reached the age of thirty. Not everyone in the older generations possesses special knowledge. It is carefully guarded from outsiders and can only be learned from a close kinsman, or purchased at considerable expense from a non-kinsmen. In most cases mastery of the lore is a complex and difficult process and various taboos must be adhered to during and after the apprenticeship. Approximately one-third of the adults over thirty have special knowledge. A few people are experts in several different forms of special knowledge; some know one kind, and some know only fragments of one kind. Although everyone knows that many kinds of special knowledge exists, any particular type is important because few others share it."
t0153 cite0105 OR19 "Each consists of ghostly powers which allow the possessor to perform significant actions that are outside the sphere of normal human ability. All forms of knowledge can also be sold, that is, taught to others in exchange for land, food, goods, or other special knowledge. In addition, most knowledge benefits the specialist, because other people must pay him for using his techniques for their benefit. A specialist in the curing of diseases associated with pregnancy and childbirth spoke as follows:"
t0153 cite0105 OR19 "“It’s this way with my knowledge. I sit here, and if a woman is sick, her husband comes to me and asks, ‘Please will you treat my wife?’ Then her people will make goods and gather goods and they will put them down before me, If I work five days (on the curing), I will not have to gather food once. To the person of special knowledge, food, goods, and land just come in.”"
t0153 cite0105 OR19 "Possession of special knowledge also relates in many ways to the character values. It makes one a person of consequence. It also increases his aggressive power, since most special knowledge includes sorcery by means of which other persons may be injured or killed. “Knowledge allows you to outdo your opponents and to laugh with derision. It lets you say ‘ah hah, you are wounded’.” Many tests of character are associated with use of special knowledge. To demonstrate his [Page 62] strong thought, a person should acquire this knowledge, but out of respectfulness he should be modest about the extent of his powers; to show “pride in knowledge” ( sikerong) is arrogance. On the other hand, all others should offer proper deference to the specialist, that is respectfulness on their part. Among the inventory of respectful behaviors there is a polite term, fewuuwicho, which people who are building a house should say to a specialist in the lore of houses, should he happen to walk by while they are working on the house. To utter this term acknowledges the master builder’s special power and status. It is equivalent to saying, “I humbly pay respects to your power. Please don’t sorcerize my house.” Failure to offer this token of respect would be taken as an indication that the workers consider the expert a person of little power who needs not be respected, or that they regard their own powers as superior. Because this is an arrogant challenge, the specialist is considered fully justified if he uses sorcery in retaliation."
t0153 cite0105 OR19 "The ideal type is a person of respectfulness, bravery, and strong thought who also controls abundant valuables. He fulfills his obligations generously, cares for numerous dependents, makes grand gifts of land, outdoes his rivals in competitive projects, and, with his bravery and special knowledge, he defeats his enemies by direct attack or sorcery. Such a person is described, in complimentary fashion, as “nearly a ghost” ( arapakkan enu). His mastery approaches that of the supernaturals."
t0154 cite0105 OR19 "Some curers specialize in the treatment of particular organs ( e.g., eyes or liver), others deal with health problems connected with pregnancy and childbirth, and still others specialize in particular types of injury or disease ( e.g., broken bones or possession by sea demon)."
t0154 cite0105 OR19 "In most cases the specialist knows how to prepare “medicine” ( sáfey) which, when somehow directed at the patient—by [Page 145] rubbing it on him, steaming him, having him drink it, or simply placing it near him—will cure or prevent a disease. Alternative forms of treatment involve spells or massage. Sometimes, there is an explicit theory about how the cure works. The medicine for possession by sea demon is said to smell so bad to the spirit that it drives him out. In other cases, the mechanics of the cure are unknown."
t0154 cite0105 OR19 "A curer is seen as matching his powers against the forces of the disease, and any successful cure is a triumph. Like other specialists, curers compete over their reputations as when one expert’s treatment fails but another’s succeeds. As an ally of one curer said, “She is the absolute number one at that curing, (in comparison) the others just understand a little.” Usually the curer knows how to cause the diseases he or she treats. An expert in childbearing can ease delivery but she can also torture a woman by prolonging it or cause her to die in the process. For this reason curers have the power and status of sorcerers."
t0155 cite0105 OR19 "Some people say that love magic is sorcery, but most consider it a distinct specialty. The usual goal is to make a victim fall in love with the practitioner or his client. It is close to sorcery because of its stealth and compulsion and also because the more powerful types may kill a person or drive him insane. Victims may break out in sores, engage in fits of screaming and rolling around in the dirt, and rip off their clothes. Many of the specialist’s techniques involve spells that call on a female spirit to change the emotions of the victim. He also makes a special medicine, “perfume of evil” ( nééngngaw), from fragrant plants and trees such as tumeric. The client annoints himself with this medicine or applies it directly to his victim."
t0155 cite0105 OR19 "As we have seen, love magic is frequently used by young men or women who are interested in someone who disdains them. One type, “fast returning” ( soratapwan), compels the return of someone who has abandoned his or her spouse. With this medicine, [Page 148] they can “reel in the deserter like a fish.” Another type, “gluing” ( apachapach) serves to stick a victim’s thoughts solely on the expert’s client. Occasionally the rival specialists confront each other as when an expert working for the wife’s kin group trys to bring back a deserting husband, while the latter pays another specialist for protection. More commonly rivals compete over their reputations. The specialist is viewed as pitting his power against the contrary inclinations of his victim. Success against a difficult subject, such as a Catholic nun or someone who is in love with another person, is considered a special triumph."
t0155 cite0105 OR19 "A.N., a specialist in love magic, and her husband had sailed with some kinsmen to a reef islet to cut copra. The couple argued, and the husband left and returned to Fáánakkar. A.N. prepared some medicine, worked her spells, and announced that her husband would be back again the next morning. That night a storm came up, it rained all night and the waters of the lagoon were rough. It seemed unlikely that anyone would attempt the long journey. At dawn, however, the people could see a canoe approaching. Of course it was A.N.’s husband. He had left the evening before and paddled all night through the storm."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "The master of strategy is the most respected, feared, and powerful practitioner of special knowledge. He has three related powers."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "1. He knows one or more dialects of the secret “language of itang” ( fóósun itang) or “deep speech” ( kkapas mwónómwón), and he knows historical oral narratives in this language."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "2. He is a master of thinking and “strategy” ( raaw), he is astute in discerning the motivations of others and manipulating them to his own advantage, and he knows esoteric ploys and maneuvers for outdoing others in warfare, formal meetings, and other contests."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "3. He controls powerful sorcery, which he uses against his enemies including rival masters of strategy."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "The secret language follows the grammatical patterns of standard Trukese, but it is laced with cryptic distortions. Secret words, altered regular words, regular words with special meanings, and esoteric metaphors make this language incomprehensible to those who speak only standard Trukese. Masters of strategy use this language among themselves and in speeches at formal meetings. It is also the medium in which they preserve “significant history” ( wuruwo), that is, history that justifies claims to valuables. It includes knowledge about the background of kin groups, about the way in which the chiefly title has passed among different groups, and the way in which plots of land have reached their present owners. Sometimes information is coded into cryptic derivations of the names of lineages, districts, or islands. Sometimes it is preserved in oral narratives, memorized word for word in the secret language. One history describes the flight of a giant man-of-war bird. As it flies along the barrier reef the ownership of different reef islands is explained. Another history tells how a ghost from the sky world invested an island’s chieftainship in a particular kin group. The first history justifies ownership of reef islands, the second validates a claim to the chieftainship, but neither is universally accepted."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "Such histories are spoken at appropriate meetings and are used when claims to valuables are in dispute. In such situations rival specialists, seeking to expand and preserve the holdings of their kin groups, districts, or islands, “flight with history.” Triumph in such contests involves more than accurate knowledge and persuasive argument. One aspect of the expert’s strategy is the fabrication of histories which provide authoritative and convincing support for claims that his group wishes to advance. Naturally, those who dispute a history may assert that it is false, but sometimes even those who support the history acknowledge that it was created to win some dispute. The specialist triumphs when he takes valuables from the opposition by intimidating them with false history."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "In warfare, the master of strategy helped to plan attacks. He devised clever tactics for deceiving and defeating the enemy, [Page 150] and he knew formal methods for deploying formations of warriors and war canoes. These maneuvers combined pragmatic strategies with esoteric ideas about the relationships of the right and wrong sides of people and canoes. The expert also tried to work sorcery on the enemy. One kind rendered the enemy warriors so sluggish and confused that they “forgot what they saw” and were unable to defend themselves. When his strategy of sorcery was successful, the enemy were said to have feared, lost to, or been injured by the expert’s power."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "Rival masters of strategy often attempt to kill each other; their encounters at formal meetings are usually sorcery battles. On the surface it seems like a respectful occasion, but throughout the meeting rivals mutter spells and seek to outmaneuver their opponents."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "When an expert is “bitten” by the sorcery of his rivals he may not fall ill for days. In other cases he is struck down at once. If he is giving a speech, his words become hesitant and garbled; then he collapses on the sand floor of the meeting house and spews out bloody vomit and exrement. If he is rushed out of the meeting house and given appropriate medicine, he sometimes survives. This kind of collapse occurred regularly in the traditional society and it has happened occasionally during the modern period, sometimes at meetings officially devoted to Christian religious subjects. Suggestibility probably plays some part, especially if the victim feels he has made an error in maneuvering."
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "Because he is regularly tested by the sorcery of his rivals, an expert must practice techniques that increase his powers. One used the following methods:"
t0156 cite0105 OR19 "He arose before dawn, left a special screened off section of the house where he slept, and walked to a beach that faced east. There he greeted the sunrise, singing out spells and pounding on the left side of his chest. In this way he intensified his power and made his words fiery, hot and dangerous. Returning to his house, he cast further spells. No one could safely talk to him, and children were silenced. On a routine day, he concluded with spells that temporarily lowered his power [Page 151] so that he and his kinsmen could discuss the activities of the day."
t0157 cite0236 OR19 "Trukese midwives are reputed experts in the diagnosis of early pregnancy. One informant said:"
t0157 cite0236 OR19 "[The American doctor] misses more than the doctor of the kanaaka. He says the woman is sick [when she is actually only pregnant]. When you make a baby, some of them just come up in your stomach, and some come up at the side of your back and hide there. Then, when the baby gets big, this is a bad place for it because there is no room to grow at the side of the back. Therefore, perhaps while you are asleep, you get a big pain. The pain is caused by the baby turning into your belly. The American doctor is not able to diagnose this kind of pregnancy until the baby turns, which it does when it gets a body—arms, etc. [AL note: author goes on to confirm higher skill among midwives, compared to other doctors.]"
t0158 cite0237 OR19 "Lands given by a sick person to the person caring for him over a long period or to a medical specialist for successful treatment of a difficult illness are also considered to be “bought” by the work of these people."
t0159 cite0106 OR19 "The more complicated types of manufacture, as well as most of the esoteric activities of healing, sorcery, magic, divination, navigation, and the like, are undertaken almost entirely by older people. A man will usually not begin to learn the skills of boat building until he has reached middle age, when he is forty years old or older. There is a feeling that until this time men are too young and irresponsible, preoccupied with their love affairs and given to idling and visiting. There is no question that with this age comes a release from the need felt for extensive sexual activity, and as the skilled manufactures as well as more esoteric activities formerly required complete sexual continence for their success and still do to a lesser extent, there is no doubt that a potential conflict of some magnitude has been resolved by this device."
t0160 cite0106 OR19 "One area in which esoteric procedures apparently retain their full aboriginal vitality and validity is that of curing the ill. The Trukese will submit readily to preventive innoculations and vaccinations and will line up for medication for pains and coughs, but when they are seriously ill the overwhelming majority remain at home to be treated by Trukese medicine. This treatment is essentially magical and consists either in exorcising or more commonly simply placating the ghost or other spirit which has entered the body of the person and is eating it, or in counteracting the effects of sorcery which, while on the wane, is still considered an active source of disease. Diagnosis is symptomatic and episodic: the relevant questions are where does it hurt, where has the person been recently, what was he doing? A diviner is then usually called in to determine what treatment should be used, and then which of those practitioners who know this treatment is the proper one to call. It is significant that it is only for diagnosis of illness that the diviner is still consistently called upon, although he may on occasion be asked to deliberate on other matters. If the practitioner selected is agreeable he begins his treatment, for a fee which may be large or small depending on whether the patient is a relative or not. The treatment may consist in steaming the affected portion of the body from a bowl which contains seawater and a plant appropriate to the disease into which is dropped a rock heated in a fire. As the steam rises, a chant is recited calling upon the offending spirit to depart from his evil works. Or medication may be rubbed, sprinkled, or poured upon the body, a spell being recited the while, or medicated coconut water or the like prepared for drinking, and amulets prepared for protection (especially against sorcery). Formerly, but apparently no longer on Truk, a spirit medium could also be called upon to communicate more directly with the spirit and find out just what he was annoyed about. [Page 65] Concurrently with magical therapy there exists a large body of massage techniques known again to specialists; while these are used primarily in cases of injury, and are often very effective, they are also used in the cure of diseases characterized by aches and pains in the joints, some sorts of abdominal pain, and so on."
t0161 cite0106 OR19 "It is felt, however, that younger men cannot long deny themselves the pleasures of women, and it is probably largely for this reason that they do not undertake the more specialized and skilled types of work which occupy an increasing amount of the time of many older men. Some types of magic, particularly those pertaining to war and learning the skills of warfare, formerly imposed sexual taboos on younger men also; these were more easily maintained when living in the lineage men’s house. Both warfare and the men’s house are now in the past and there are very few occasions left in which younger men must observe ritual continence on Truk. Older men, however, continue to observe the taboos, particularly during the manufacture of such objects as canoes and their equipment; these skills and their associated magic are not taught to younger men. In tabulating the makers of canoes, paddles, bailers, wooden fish spears, and the like, Dr. LeBar found that the youngest among them was listed as being thirty-nine years of age (which is probably a low estimate on the part of the island secretary), and they averaged forty-seven. They all observe to some degree the magic traditionally associated with their craft and are stated to avoid intercourse with their wives until their task is done, although they continue to sleep at home. They have learned their skills from yet older men and will shortly pass them on to men somewhat younger, in both cases members of their lineage or other close relatives."
t0162 cite0106 OR19 "Although women, as we have noted, do not have to avoid heterosexual contacts as a consequence of any work they may undertake, they like the men tend to learn skills only after they are well into adult status. The principal crafts practiced by women are the making of nets, baskets, and plaited fans; the average age for producers of these items on Romonum was found by LeBar to be forty-one. However, at least one woman skilled in the manufacture of each of these items was in her early twenties, and both Irene and Rachel were taught these and other crafts when still in their teens. Although these are exceptions, such exceptions do not appear in the case of male artisans."
t0163 cite0238 OR19 "A revealing illustration of the mixture of feelings which a niffag may entail was given by an informant who was discussing the taboos surrounding a magical specialist. The particular specialist has it in his power to make another person who has offended him sick by inviting the latter to share with him a meal consisting of taboo food. The victim later gathers together sufficient goods to make a handsome present to the specialist, who is also the only one who knows the cure. As our informant put it, the specialist now “likes” his victim and prepares the necessary medicine to remove the affliction. A niffag is thus felt to have the power to change another’s attitude even when its purpose is perfectly clear."
t0164 cite0238 OR19 "The above considerations are extended by analogy to knowledge and skills which do not in their application directly create corporeal property, such, for example, as the magical and medicinal formulae used to cure illness. Knowledge of this kind is freely applied to the curing of a lineage mate or other close relative as a personal favor. Any one else, however, must pay in advance. The patient brings goods to the specialist and requests his aid. When cured, he is further obligated to the practioner and makes him a present. Such knowledge, then, not only has practical social value, but through its application can provide other forms of wealth for the specialist. To this knowledge, too, the specialist’s children and lineage mates have a claim. Without their permission, he may not teach it to another unless he receives compensation for it. For if the specialist teaches someone else, he dissipates the monopoly his heirs will someday enjoy and lowers their future earning power."
t0165 cite0238 OR19 "Instruction is by no means confined, however, to such formal situations. Much of the teaching of magic and skills is limited to occasions when the teacher is called upon to apply his knowledge. When Kekin of Romonum, for example, was asked to build a canoe, he took this occasion to encourage his son, Renipu, to come out with him and get started on the long road to becoming a master builder, a sineenap (main knower). Renipu was but seventeen years old, and his interest was slight. As he grows older he will accompany his father more and more in such activities and slowly acquire the knowledge. Since the number of canoes a man builds is limited—there are no full-time specialists on Truk—it takes several years for him to transmit his knowledge, all of which must be committed to memory, to his sons or junior lineage mates. For this reason the more complicated specialized forms of knowledge are concentrated in the hands of older people. Romonum Island, with a population of 240 souls, for example, has but three recognized master canoe builders. All three have only a few active years ahead of them, and each now has adult children. There is also one man about 40 years of age who is a skillful adzeman and has made a couple of small canoes on his own. He is not considered the equal of the other three, however, and drops in on them when they are at work to see what additional pointers he can pick up. The younger people are just starting seriously to try their hands at such work. Several middle-aged men were attempting their first canoes when our field work was being conducted. These attempts were modest, and the builders were usually so related to the master builders [Page 55] that they could call upon them for advice and help, and even to perform for them some of the more critical operations such as laying out the right measurements. ..."
t0165 cite0238 OR19 "Most important, however, is the fact that a person must learn from his father or an older lineage mate. Until the death of an established craftsman, his pupil is not likely to be called upon to exercise his skills and knowledge for others or to have the chance to reap the attendant rewards. Only as some of the older experts die off do those a little younger begin to get recognized as experts themselves, since they serve much the same clientele of kinsmen and neighbors as their predecessors did. In line with this is the expert’s tendency to transmit his knowledge piecemeal, withholding some portion of it until he is too old to exercise his skill."
t0166 cite0238 OR19 "All religious practitioners as well as craftsmen and magicians are owners of the knowledge necessary to exercise their specialties. The Trukese make no distinction between them and other skilled personnel. There is one important exception to this rule, the spirit medium ( wäättwa or wään ëny). His (or her) position is not based on knowledge so much as on having been possessed by a spirit. This spirit is in no way classed as the medium’s property, nor can it be inherited automatically by a son or lineage mate. The position of a spirit medium, therefore, is different from that of a property holder, except as he uses his abilities to diagnose illness."
t0167 cite0238 OR19 "There are persons to whom the verbal behavior pattern “ fääjiro!” is spoken as a greeting. Such persons are district chiefs or jitag. 2 The expression is uttered only if one is “taboo from above” ( pin me wöön) the chief or jitag. 2 An jitag is a specialist with combined skill in oratory, law, tradition, diplomacy, and military tactics. He stands at the top of the native prestige ladder."
t0168 cite0239 OR19 "He [AL note: another author] called attention, moreover, to the significant fact that the people of Kosrae had no knowledge of how to build or sail voyaging canoes nor any knowledge of navigation (1893:478). Such knowledge, we should add, was also limited on Ponape. In Truk it was known only to a very few of chiefly rank, and they were dependent for it on specialists from the surrounding atolls, from which they also imported their sailing canoes (Kubary 1889:62; Girschner 1912:181). In Yap, sailing canoes were of the type used by the Trukic speaking atoll dwellers to the east, and Yapese terminology relating to navigation is clearly a borrowing from a Trukic source."
t0169 cite0240 OR19 "Tattooing was done by male specialists and was performed on both sexes. Native methods of tattooing ceased on Truk at about the beginning of the Japanese administration of the islands. Arms, hands, and thighs were the areas most often treated. Informants stated that the tattoo functioned only as an erotic stimulus; they could give no instances of special territorial, kinship, or status markings. The erotic factor was elaborated by one male informant who stated that the tattoo marks visible on the thighs and buttocks of a woman when she removed her wrap-around skirt excited him greatly. He commented on the fact that the women of Mortlock tattooed these areas to a greater extent than did the women of Truk. The age at which tattooing was done varied from about fifteen to thirty."
t0170 cite0241 OR19 "The next day I learned that Q had gone home and flung himself headfirst off the roof of his house, landing on his chest on a large basalt boulder. A specialist in traditional massage medicine was called in to [Page 80] treat his broken bones and hard and distended abdomen caused by internal injuries. While his family sat around crying over him, the massage specialist worked on him daily for nearly a week without any improvement. One week after his jump, Q was admitted to the hospital in critical condition. He had neither spoken nor eaten during this period. When I left Truk two and a half months later Q remained in the hospital in guarded condition."
t0171 cite0108 OQ06 "When the pains begin the woman in labor bathes in the house. Her mother, mother-in-law, or grandmother acts as midwife and gives her a medicine to facilitate delivery. The recipe for this medicine is an inherited or purchased secret, carefully guarded by the owner. The best midwife on Kambara makes it of beaten hibiscus bark placed in a coconut reticulum bag and steeped in water. A skilled midwife determines [Page 31] by touch whether the unborn child is correctly placed. If not she manipulates it by massage into the proper position at the beginning of labor. ..."
t0171 cite0108 OQ06 "The midwife catches the infant as he emerges. If he is short of breath she blows water from her mouth into his face, or she gives a cup of water to the mother and massages the umbilical cord gently with thumb and index finger. If the mother is faint the midwife gives her “medicine to restore her breath”, made according to her private recipe. When the child is breathing regularly the umbilical cord is cut by the mother's mother or the midwife. This was formerly done with a shell or a bamboo knife. The method, introduced by the government, of cutting the cord with a pair of scissors and tying it with a piece of string, is used occasionally. An old Fulanga woman thinks that the modern method of tying the cord is injurious because the bad blood cannot flow away. As [Page 32] soon as the child is born the mother is given a second drink of medicine to bring forth the afterbirth. If it does not appear the mother's abdomen is pressed and the cord is pulled."
t0172 cite0109 OT11 "In fishing, especially deep-sea fishing, and in some other crafts, knowledge of the technical processes and of the associated [Page 103] ritual is unequally distributed. As could be expected, it is linked with special mannal aptitude in them. Here are terms not for industrious persons as such, but for skilled, knowledgeable persons, such as tufu[unknown]a (expert craftsman), tautai (sea-expert), and ta[unknown]ata o atu (man of bonito) (see later). One effect of the possession of such knowledge lacking in others is the opportunity of enlarging one's resources. This is done by resort to fishing banks not commonly known, or use of a special technique at times when the fish refuse all others; or, in the case of a craftsman, by more prompt replacement of his implements, or by gaining goods in payment for his work for others; or to a small extent by the securing of a material return for the imparting of his knowledge to others. Important as an inducement to the acquisition of such personal knowledge, however, is the prestige that it obtains."
t0173 cite0109 OT11 "What has been said above [that chiefs and leaders tend to be more knowledgeable than laypersons] refers primarily to the knowledge of ritual procedure, names of the gods and the like. To some extent the distribution of purely technical knowledge follows the same pattern, though here there is more tendency for younger men to acquire a fund of information which they can put to immediate practical use. But on the whole I found, naturally enough, that elderly men had a much greater range of knowledge and were much more conversant with precise details than the younger men. Moreover, there is no rigid separation between technical and ritual knowledge, and the recognition of certain men, either chiefs or commoners, as experts means that they are not only skilled above the average in the actual performance of a craft, and know more about its technical details, but that they have a greater body of knowledge about the ritual which pertains to it."
t0174 cite0109 OT11 "In the emergence of a specialist craftsman individual training plays some part, as when a father makes for his son a model of a house lashing in order to demonstrate the peculiar technique involved, or has the lad at his side when he is engaged in woodwork, or in fishing. But here the personal factors of individual interest and aptitude are paramount and there is no attempt to force the child into following his father's special craft. Since every specialist also takes part in the general productive activity in other fields there is plenty of scope for any member of a family who shows no particular bent for a specialized craft. Some children appear to develop as specialists at quite an early age. Seuku, a boy of about twelve, was a wood-worker to whom other boys went to get heads for their darts. These were quite passable specimens, as was also a model of a club which he made for his own interest and which I bought from him. Again, when some children imitated a current activity of their elders and began to remodel the bow of a small canoe, it was Seuku who acted as tufu[unknown]a and directed the work. Seuku appeared to have developed [Page 115] largely on his own initiative; neither his father nor his elder brothers had any special proficiency as wood-workers. On the other hand there is sometimes a continuity in the practice of a craft by members of a family, as in tattooing. 1"
t0174 cite0109 OT11 "For some details see Man . 1936, 236."
t0174 cite0109 OT11 "The house of Niukapu has an ancient tradition of seamanship; and the chiefly house of Taumako a reputation for skill in all the major crafts. A man of Tafua, who could be expected to belittle rather than praise their accomplishments, said to me, “They are the tufu[unknown]a house in this land; they are expert indeed in all things.”"
t0175 cite0242 OT11 "But for such taboos to be respected at all, there had to be some information, even minimally, about them. In 1952 many of the older Christians had still such information, and though they might regard it as outmoded as a basis for active belief, they still tended to treat it as a status property. One man, for instance, was proud of his former skill as a chanter of the ceremonial public formula of thanks shouted in acknowledgement of a feast given by a chief. In the traditional Tikopia schemes such feasts were not only marks of the advancing age and status of the chief but were also occasions for his public worship of his gods and ancestors. (I heard such a recital in May 1952 at a feast of the Ariki Taumako.) The reciter of this formula ( oriori ) had to be a man of fluent tongue, good articulation and lung power, clear memory and high status. The recital of the oriori was in a sense a mark of allegiance to the pagan system. Yet this Christian vaunted his prowess. ‘The man who recites the oriori must be an expert; the man who is not clever will go wrong!’ 1 Many other Tikopia who had participated in pagan rites but were now Christian regarded their knowledge as giving them status."
t0176 cite0243 OT11 "The “magic” of protection is much more limited in its practitioners. On the one hand, there are those who have a specific status entitlement -- ritual elders of lineages ( matapure ) and especially chiefs of clans ( ariki ) -- to care for the welfare of their group members. But while Tikopia is rigid in its adherence to the principle of patrilineal descent, it does not confine spiritual benefits so closely, and custom allows help to be obtained by resort to another than one's own lineage or clan head. (This custom has an advantage in that it is part of the mechanism of organization in practice and theory to deal with failure.)"
t0176 cite0243 OT11 "On the other hand, “magic” of protection can also be performed by persons of another social category, the spirit mediums ( vaka atua ). For practice in this capacity no particular status is required, only the ability to enter a state of dissociation and give the appropriate social responses. Here is an opportunity for women. No woman can be a chief or a ritual elder, 6 but it is not uncommon for women, of ordinary as well as chiefly families, to be spirit mediums. Nor is this thought abnormal, or disapproved of, and they attend male as well as female patients. The “magical” procedures of protection and healing are more highly specialized and individualized than those of production. Much of them is common knowledge in the society at large, but the practitioners are regarded as having the special entitlement by status or capacity which secures them from imitation. No-one would use a procedure he had just [Page 102] “picked up”, as he might with some “magic” of production. There is a higher degree of esoteric conten', a greater degree of systematization, a more complete “performance”."
t0177 cite0244 OT11 "The training of a boy, however, is often due to the interest of one of his mother's brothers in him. If this man is an expert in any branch of knowledge he will probably see to it that his nephew receives some of the results of his experience. If he is a noted canoe-voyager and fisherman he will pass on his store of information in the finer points of his craft to the lad: especially will he show him the location of fishing-banks, a prized set of date not possessed by all fishermen. In dirges composed to the memory of mothers' brothers refereuce is not infrequently made to this sort of assistance. A grandfather may take a great interest in a child's upbringing and may provide him with traditional lore, names of family ancestor and their history, tales of ancient fights and immigrations of the origins of the land and the doings of the gods. The transmitation of details of family ritual and more esoteric information concerning the family religious life is essentially the role of the father, and not infrequently does the head of a house lament the fact of his own comparative ignorance due to his father's early death. Individual circumstances vary considerably in this respect, but as a rule in such cases the gap is filled more or less adequately by a father's brother or even a father's sister, who will be acquainted in some degree with the requisite information."
t0178 cite0244 OT11 "In the course of time certain paito have come to possess an individuality, to be credited with a set of traits peculiar to their members, which has been acquired through generations of achievement or [Page 352] habit. Thus the house of Taumako are recognized as toa , men of strong personality, and virile, ready to fight and to command. In the traditional account of Tikopia history this reputation has been fairly consistently upheld throughout the centuries. Present members of this house are recognized as keepers of the peace in the island, and exercise considerable authority of a personal kind for which no allowance is made in the social structure. They are also a house of craftsmen, particularly as workers in wood. The house of Niukapu are renowned particularly as tautai , sea-experts. Various ancestors of theirs in the past have been noted sea-voyagers and navigators, a reputation which the folk of Taumako also share to some degree. The house of Tafua, which has had noted voyagers in its time, is known at the present time principally for its prowess in fishing, and also in the dance."
t0179 cite0244 OT11 "Young women in song sometimes assert their intention of scorning marriage, but there is in Tikopia no other career which offers any real social advantages. The type of spirit mediumship which [a woman] obtains does not sufficiently differentiate its practitioners from the general body of people to provide women with any great inducement to pursue it as their sole vocation."
t0180 cite0245 SR15 "The pursuit of First-Time knowledge is a strictly solitary endeavor, and in any clan the number of older men considered really to “know things” can be counted on a single hand. (Women and youths, with few exceptions, are prohibited a priori from entering deeply into the world of First-Time knowledge.) Within any clan, each expert’s knowledge is idiosyncratic, learned from a unique network of older kinsmen and reflecting that individual’s particular strengths as a historian. Over the course of his adult lifetime, each interested man must construct his own images and analyses of “what really happened” two and three centuries ago, based on bits and pieces of relevant songs and rites, disputes, and celebrations that he makes it his business to attend to, as well as on the supplementary narratives he is able to wheedle out of his often-reluctant older kinsmen. The Saramaka historian-in-training hoes a very long row; those that take it on as a vocation, like the very finest of our own historians, seem positively driven by an inner need to make sense of the past, quite apart from the prestige that may incidentally accrue from their special mastery."
t0180 cite0245 SR15 "It may be useful to contrast the solitary nature of the Saramaka historian’s vocation with the collective efforts of elders in certain other societies to preserve secret and dangerous knowledge. In Pueblo society, for example, it is small groups that strive to maintain a monopoly on such knowledge: “Religious knowledge is necessary for political power within the community. If this knowledge can be restricted to a very small group, that group can control the community” (Brandt 1980: 131). In Saramaka, however, where the idea of a “body” of First-Time knowledge or the idea of a “group” of initiates is largely absent, individuals tend to operate independently in the acquisition, dissemination, and use of such knowledge, even when it is offered up or called upon in the service of a social group. Because of the noncollective nature of the learning and use of First-Time knowledge, disagreements and confrontations are largely avoided; it is accepted that different Saramaka historians will have different versions, and it is up to the listener to piece together for himself the version of an event that he, for the time being, accepts."
t0180 cite0245 SR15 "Several of the most knowledgeable Saramaka historians explicitly credit their accumulation of special knowledge to their own natural curiosity and “shameless” insistence in pressing their elders."
t0181 cite0245 SR15 "For historically-knowledgeable Saramakas, Kwasímukámba represents the prototypical symbol of betrayal, a constant reminder of the necessity to be guarded in all relations with outsiders. As we have seen in the first section of this book, everyday Saramaka proverbs and folktales are filled with morals about not trusting other people, and the story of nóuna, outlined there, was considered emblematic of such concerns. But the idea—expressed so often in daily life—that knowledge is power, and that one should not reveal all of what one knows, becomes magnified enormously for Saramakas whenever dealing with First-Time, with ritual, or with [Page 154] outsiders. And the highly secret story of Kwasímukámba combines all three of these contexts of heightened danger. This is why it has come to epitomize for Saramakas all of the fearsome risks of sharing confidences with outsiders."
t0182 cite0246 SR15 "Although certain women are known for their ability to assist with pregnancies and births, they undergo no formal training. Rather, women with other kinds of ritual expertise slowly accumulate experience as midwives by being consulted on particular problems, and shift very gradually into the role of a “woman who delivers with people,” usually when they are postmenopausal."
t0183 cite0247 SQ19 "About twenty years ago, José of Anüyuhtí longhouse went to hunt white-lipped peccaries. He shot one, which was especially fierce because its mate was about to give birth. The peccary gored José in the knee, but he killed it with his dogs. He limped back to the longhouse, carrying the dead peccary. The wound got very bad. Old Arturo, the most knowledgeable of Bará shamans, started a curing chant, but José was ready to die. His feet were already cold and only his heart moved. Old Arturo went to Ewüra wi, a longhouse near Ewüra taró. He saw José already there, standing outside the door. He was putting on black body paint, festive ornaments, and feathers. His mother and his father were there, and many people awaited him. José had almost finished painting himself and was about to enter the longhouse. If he had entered, he would have died in this world. The people at Anüyuhtí were already crying. Old Arturo came and pushed José away from the doorway. Many peccaries were outside the house waiting, and Old Arturo began to scare them with his power. First he summoned a big wind. The peccaries said that wind had been around since the beginning of the world. Then Old Arturo summoned a tremendous fire, which did scare them. They lined up and began to enter the longhouse. He made them shut all the doors, which he closed with big logs. Old Arturo took away [Page 50] their aüawüri (long flutes), taking away their dances, taking away their hearts. When Old Arturo returned to this world, he carried these flutes in his throat, and José recovered. But this is why there are no peccaries in these parts today."
t0184 cite0248 SF05 "Compi children gain knowledge not only in school and by the informal education of their parents in domestic skills, they also acquire specialized skills and knowledge of herbal cures, magical and religious rites, omens, the network of kinship and the local political structure and the traditional measurements of time, space, and weight, The extent of their knowledge of the foregoing depends on whether a member of the family is a specialist; the children of curers are better acquainted with herbal remedies than the other children in the community."
t0185 cite0249 SF05 "Not only do they [the Aymara] have an extraordinary number of categories of doctors and practitioners, and a variety of medical and magical procedures, a striking native knowledge and nomenclature of anatomy, and an enormous list of materia medica--thus far a development of purely “professional” skills--but they also, as laymen, have a considerable participation in this specialized knowledge, and are constantly “doctoring” themselves with common remedies for their almost daily ills. ..."
t0185 cite0249 SF05 "Aymara medicine is highly specialízed, and consequently has a great many different categories of practitioners. The following all practice medicine in one form or another: the q'olawayu (from q'ofa , medicine, and wayu , a kind of bolsa); the amau[unknown]a (a learned man, the same as ha[unknown]ca amtañani , “[one] with big thoughts,” ha[unknown]camunani ,“[one] with much affection,” i.e.,practitioner of good magic, and ha[unknown]ca[unknown]eq'enu , “[one] with a big head”); the various witches like the laiq'a , or the tala ( tata ); the diagnosticians or diviners like the mifu[unknown]ciri the q'oa[unknown]ciri , and the kukatuñiri ; the [unknown]camakani (lit., “with darkness”) and the [unknown]camakiri (“he who darkens”) who call at night upon their familiar spirits--owls, snakes, frogs, and birds--in hunting out and counteracting witchcraft; the loq'tiri (from loq'ta , sacrifice) who makes offerings to the spirits; the yatiri, q'amiri, t'aliri, ham[unknown]iri, q'amili ; the sir[unknown]oq'amani and q'ofaq'amani (“he who has cures,” and “he who has medicines,” respectively); and the various other specialists who practice the methods of curing by t'alantaña, [unknown]c'uimaq'aq'oña (a kind of chiropractic), truq'aq'a, lum[unknown]aq'a , and pi[unknown]c'aq'a . It is probably safe to say that no other primitive group known to modern ethnology has such a rich specialization among practitioners of native medicine. ..."
t0185 cite0249 SF05 "This behavior of the Collawayu makes clear several facts which are true of all Aymara medicine in general. Since disease is caused by the evil machinations of witches and spirits, the medicine-man must both divine the cause, overcome it with more powerful witchcraft, and cure the ill medically or magically as the case may be. The difference between the various practitioners, therefore, is not only in the means of divination which they employ but also in the character of their magic, and in the mode of curing. However, the witches such as the laiq'a or the tala pass over easily into the counter-witches like the [unknown]camakani and the [unknown]camakiri , both of whom work in the dark of night."
t0186 cite0249 SF05 "The sirkaq'amani is the Aymara surgeon, who treats fractures, luxations, and wounds. Very probably it was this practitioner who in ancient times 312 [Page 224] performed the trephinings for which this region is famous among physical anthorpologists and archaeologists. Skulls have been found with as many as five successful trepanations--which argues for a certain skill in the surgeon, as well as for the vitality of the patient. Krogman 313 considers that the purpose of trephining was to relieve compression fractures of the skull caused by warclubs, but Ronhaar believes that trephining was performed most often for epilepsy or migraine (if the epilepsy were traumatic, it comes to the same thing). Trepanation was done by sawing, cutting, scraping, and drilling with chips of flint, obsidian, quartz, and possibly blades of copper. A gourd, shell, or plaque of silver controlled the herniation of the brain through the operation. Similar is the bleeding performed upon the root of the nose, although this may have been to relieve the swelling in this area caused by a disease called “Gundu.” Another surgical procedure was to tie off multiple lipomata with horse-hairs until they sloughed off."
t0187 cite0249 SF05 "Important as are the many kinds of practitioners mentioned in the preceding section, the most important of all are the various kinds of q'oliri (chief among whom is the q'olawayu ) who use plant, animal, and mineral substances as actual medicines. These medicines are used both externally and internally, as poultices and as ptisans or infusions. By far the greater number of Aymara medicines are of plant origin, the detailed discussion and identification of which is to be published elsewhere. Many of these (e.g., airampu, Opuntia soehrensii Britton and Rose), a cactus used in treating angina, seem pharmacologically very plausible as medicines, for related species are already part of official European pharmacopoeias. Others, such as quinine, are still the best drugs known to modern science for specific purposes. One might well urge the attention of chemists, pharmacologists, and doctors to such native medicines, for laboratory research might on occasion establish their scientific value."
t0188 cite0114 SF05 "Much love magic is practiced, either by the interested party or, at his or her instigation, by a practitioner of white ( paqo ) or black magic ( laiqa ). Charms and spells are used to attract a lover, to repel an unwanted spouse or lover, or to break up a happy union (Paredec, 1936, pp. 76-77, 121-22). Diviners are frequently consulted to find out what type of spouse should be sought or to discover the infidelity of a husband or wife."
t0189 cite0114 SF05 "Powers to cure disease are shared by several classes of doctors, who are distinguished by the types of disease in which they specialize, their techniques of diagnosis, and their methods of curing. In addition to specialists in magical cures (see Practitioners of Magic, p. 564), three classes of medical practitioners (the qolawayu , the t'aliri , and the qolasiri ) cure by essentially practical means, although employing some magic. These doctors appear to require no supernatural experience in order to practice their professions."
t0189 cite0114 SF05 "The medical terminology is complex. The generic word for medicine is qola and for doctor, qolasiri , literally, “he who knows medicine”; other names for doctors refer specifically to the techniques they employ. Although either sex may practice medicine, most doctors are men. Doctors who continually fail in their cures are often driven from the community and occasionally are killed by the angry relatives of a deceased patient."
t0190 cite0114 SF05 "The t'aliri are chiropractors and usually also midwives. In Chucuito, Perú (total population 554), there are three t'aliri , two of whom are old women, while one is an old man. The Aymara believe that the heart may be dislocated through shock or an accident, whereupon these practitioners are engaged to return it to its normal position by massage and by jerking the patient's torso."
t0191 cite0114 SF05 "The qolasiri are bone-setters, herbalists, and general practitioners who tend strongly to specialize. Some are known for their abilities to diagnose disease, some for their success in internal medicine, and others for their skill as bone-setters. The qolasiri ordinarily divines with coca, but uses a guinea pig for more important cases. He places the live guinea pig in contact with the patient's body for a short time, [Page 570] after which the patient breathes on it three times. The guinea pig is then cut open and examined; any defective organs indicate which of the patient's organs are diseased. In a similar diagnosis, an unidentified mineral called qolpa is placed in contact with the patient's body, burned, and the cause of disease divined from its remains. A third technique involves a mineral ( mi[unknown]u, largely alum) which is placed in the patient's urine (La Barre, ms.)."
t0192 cite0114 SF05 "In Chucuito, there are two qolabiri , both of whom are middleaged men. One of these individuals learned to cure from his father, while the other learned from his paternal uncle."
t0192 cite0114 SF05 "After the diagnosis, the doctor may cure with various medicines. The disease, if due to evil spirits, may be transferred magically to the object used in the diagnosis, which is then either destroyed or returned to the source of the evil, or the disease may be magically sent away. The patient is made to lie down on a blanket which is covered with food, clothing, and valuables, after which he is washed and the water and the other objects deposited near a river; whoever carries away these also carries away the disease. Formerly, in the event of an epidemic, a black llama was loaded with the clothing of the infected person and driven out of the village to carry away the disease (Forbes, 1870, p. 45)."
t0193 cite0115 SF05 "Hostility towards relatives and other Aymara of the community is expressed principally through sorcery and lawsuits. Through the medium of the sorcerer and his black magic the individual is able to punish his enemy in a socially recognized, if socially disapproved, manner (see p. 283). This specialist, the laiqa , is a disinterested professional practitioner whose services are available to all and to whom no blame is usually attached. Such an indirect and oblique attack to a degree satisfies the cultural prohibition against open hostility; at the same time, this sly, underhanded, and secret act enables the person to express his hostile impulses without letting others know its source or who is involved. 3 Lawsuits likewise satisfy the cultural requirements in that they are conducted objectively and through a disinterested professional intermediary. As in sorcery, the aggrieved person is able to vent his hostility and to see his enemy humiliated or punished even though, as not infrequently happens, he himself becomes bankrupted in the process."
t0193 cite0115 SF05 "The non-aggressive ways of handling hostility, [Page [p. 181 b]] touched upon in the foregoing pages, can be summarized briefly as follows: Gossip and ridicule represent responses that are widely employed, and the malice so expressed tends to be biting, direct, and sustained. Owing to the progressive breakdown of cooperative enterprises, however, the opportunities for effective public ridicule are becoming increasingly infrequent. While gossip is effective in the more closely knit society of Chucuito village, it is far less potent among the scattered Aymara of the ayllus."
t0194 cite0114 SF05 "Much has been written about the qolawayu , the most famous of Aymara doctors. (See Paredes, 1936, pp. 185-95; Bandelier, 1910, pp. 103, 155; La Barre, ms.) These traveling herbalists and vendors of amulets live chiefly in the Provinces of Caupolicán and Muñecas in Bolivia and constitute a special cultural subgroup of the Aymara . They possess distinctive dress and customs, and are said by some to speak a special dialect of the Aymara language. All men of this subtribe are trained as herbalists. They travel widely over South America, often being away from their villages for several years."
t0195 cite0114 SF05 "Doctors also administer emetics and cathartics but use no enemas. Herbs are given to speed difficult births and to shorten menstrual periods. Sprains and dislocations are massaged with chewed coca. While bloodletting is occasionally practiced, it is probably of Spanish introduction (Bandelier, ms.)."
t0195 cite0114 SF05 "Surgery today is simple; amputation is not practiced, nor teeth extracted. Broken bones are set in many thin splints. Formerly, the Aymara successfully trepanned crania in order to relieve depressed skull fractures, although this practice appears to be obsolete today. If the patient is in pain, he is made to drink himself into a state of insensibility and to chew a quantity of coca for its anesthetic effect."
t0196 cite0115 SF05 "In one form or another, coca is part of the ritual paraphernalia of every Aymara practitioner. Divination with coca leaves is the stock-in-trade of the yatiri , while the qolasiri uses coca in diagnosis, as a medicine, and, occasionally, as an anaesthetic. The midwife compounds is into childbirth remedies, and the t'aliri employs it for massages. Sorcerers offer coca to demons and to evil places; in the practice of benevolent magic it is an integral and necessary part of all offerings: to spirits, cairns, and shrines, to perfect vegetables and fish, to amulets and sacred objects, and occasionally to disease itself. In addition, during All Souls fiesta, coca is offered to the dead."
t0197 cite0250 SO11 "Rural Bahian families were indeed self-sufficient in their healing, but their isolation forced it on them. On plantations, the master was often obliged to attempt healing. In the 1860’s, the head of the Pinheiro Canguçu family treated virtually every ailment of family members and moradores on his plantation, consulting a medical handbook and traditional family recipes, leaving only amputations to the doctor from Caetité. With the habit of self-reliance came skepticism of the special knowledge of doctors. Anna Ribeiro’s family did not get her eyes treated in the 1850’s because they did not trust doctors. One treatment to decrease her eye inflammation had left the scars of abscesses on her upper arms."
t0197 cite0250 SO11 "As doctors asserted authority over parents, they confronted, not the patriarch, but rather other figures who could claim expertise. The medical literature on childbearing and childrearing abounds in attacks on wet nurses, midwives, and old wives who might presume to speak with authority or to interpret tradition. Theses and treatises on childbirth typically mention with contempt the baths in wine given to newborns by superstitious midwives. Wet nurses, besides being “mercenary,” were to be condemned because they were “[in our country] ordinarily Africans, stupid, immoral, without education,” and they were stigmatized as bearers of syphilis. But the generalized attack on customs, on usos, commonly identified no specific culprit. It implied that women’s lore was superstition. Significantly, a guide addressed to a general public, rather than a thesis directed principally to other doctors, made this most explicit, saying that pregnancy is usually simple if the woman follows good sense and hygiene, not popular tales and the advice of “matrons.”"
t0198 cite0250 SO11 "On midwives, see Cerqueira, Prophylaxia alimentar (1903), p. 18. Although one twentieth-century doctor, Almeida Gouvéia, was able to assemble strong evidence of the perniciousness of the old ways, in most cases in the nineteenth century, the attack did not rest on such clear empirical evidence. Almeida Gouvéia’s well—documented thesis traced infant tetanus mortality to home births on certain streets, and ultimately to the unlicensed midwives ( aparadeiras) living on those streets, who probably applied the traditional plasters of spiderweb powder, dung, and tobacco dust to the umbilicus (Gouvéia, Puericultura social, p. 207)."
t0199 cite0251 SO11 "One of Bahia’s most exclusive clubs, membership in which is definitely indicative of advanced social status, is composed of Bahian “society,” including most of the leading officials and many of the more prominent citizens. Numerous receptions for visiting celebrities are held at this club, and its dances are considered to be among the principal social functions of the year. No blacks have yet been admitted, although several mixed-bloods, including a number of brancos da Bahia and even a few dark mulattoes, are regular and honored members. Whites, of course, predominate."
t0199 cite0251 SO11 "Among the members is a dark mixed-blood, with Caucasian hair and features, a prominent citizen, an able eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist trained in Europe, and husband of a white wife. Of him a Bahian of undiluted European descent once commented, “You know when I went to see him about my eyes the other day, I never once thought of him as colored. I needed professional advice and I simply recalled that he, like his father before him, was the best eye specialist in Bahia.” Another member of this club is a dark mixed-blood, a wealthy exporter, prominent in Bahian commercial circles, and husband of a white wife, upon whose visits into the interior, it is said, all those with whom he has business dealings (including whites) feel deeply honored when he visits them in their homes."

If he is Kiye or Bokodori Echerae, there will be no difficulty in finding precedents for intra-moiety relations. ... The ensuing rule is quite clear: you can have sexual relations with whomever pleases you, but, as a civilized man with respect for tradition and a little fear of your yorubodare , you should marry a woman from the opposite moiety."
t0201 cite0252 SM04 "The Jesuits, nevertheless, attempted to save Indian lives by having them build separate hospitals for men and women and another hospital for those women who were pregnant and about to give birth to a child. Instead of hospital beds, the sick Indians slept in cotton hammocks. Ideally, the natives constructed these hospitals outside the mission towns, but some hospitals were built near the main plazas in the center of town, such as those at Apostoles and San Nicolás. The Jesuits also instructed the Indians to build many temporary, individual shelters called teyupas for those Indians they suspected might have a headache or displayed other early warning signs of a virus. This way those Guaraní who were coming down with an illness were kept in isolation from their families and other members of the community. In each mission, there were at least four to eight native medical practitioners, nurses and curanderos (medicine men) who relied upon their traditional herbal remedies to cure the sick. If their natural herbs proved to be ineffective, then the practitioners would consult with the missionaries who served as physicians on the missions and had access to medical books in the mission library. 110 In this respect, the Jesuits highly valued and adopted the natives’ use of herbal medicine to heal the Indians to a certain extent. During epidemics, the missionaries asked those Indians who were healthy enough to have recovered from an illness or disease to care for those Indians who were sick. Evidently, the Jesuits knew that these natives had built up immunities which would prevent them from falling ill again. These voluntary nurses usually fed the [Page 222] sick a special diet of squash ( andai ), barley, and other vegetables, instead of the usual meat, manioc, and mbeyú (manioc pancakes). The Jesuits accepted the use of a native herbal remedy called aguaraibay which the Indians used to bathe themselves and which would help heal sores on their bodies caused by a disease. When the Indians burned this native plant inside the hospital, the missionaries believed that the smoke would help stop the spread of disease by purifying the buildings. On the other hand, in the minds of the Indians, the smoke may have driven away any evil spirits which caused their illnesses. The clothes of those Indians who recuperated were also burned, and he or she was given a new set of clothes before returning to the town. 111 All of these protective measures most likely helped to prevent the spread of disease in the missions. Since the Jesuits practiced the concept of isolation and the burning of the clothes of those Guaraní who were stricken with disease, the natives probably benefited from the Jesuits’ knowledge of medical treatment, which appears to have been more advanced than in Spanish American colonial towns in this period."
t0202 cite0117 SM04 "Medicine made up a small portion of household expenditures. Indigenous medicines are effective against most ailments such as parasitosis or headaches, but Chiripá use commercial medicines against more persistent problems. The local mestizo medical specialist is a poorly trained pharmacist who sells a variety of Brazilian medicines from his home. Pain relievers and antibiotics are dispensed in packets of one or two, making them accessible (if not effective) to the consumer with even a small amount of cash. Major medical problems, such as tuberculosis or leishmaniasis, are treated by roving doctors supported by international agencies."
t0536 cite0253 FE12 "Even the fundamental principle of matriliny, allegiance to the mother's kin, was voided in highly hierarchical situations before conquest. The most ancient and honorable exception applied to the asomfo, the courtiers and servants of the Asantehene and, by extension, the Asante state. These men were expressly given control of their own children, directly canceling the power of the maternal uncle, so that they could train their own sons without interference as skilled successors [Page 97] to their technical and political offices. Interestingly enough, although these rules applied to substantial numbers of Kumasi residents before conquest, and I knew a few traders with family connections to the palace, none of them mentioned the asomfo pattern among marital alternatives. Patrifiliation through slave wives came up more often as a means for wealthy commoner men to gain wives and children with primary loyalty to them, not matrilineal kin. A wealthier man could also acquire pawned wives, who could not work for themselves or go home. Most market women I knew had neither the wealth nor the close royal connections to aspire to elite standards of behavior, so the less hierarchical models had more relevance."
t0537 cite0254 FE12 "I intend to deal only with the native custom, and I may here state that I have always relied rather on illiterate natives and chiefs, for my information, than on educated native men, for the following reasons:—the illiterate native tells one all he knows, or all he dares, and, having no reason to lie when he is not in court, he generally relates facts. A chief is the judge of his people, and, with his councillors, is the repository and exponent of the law, and must necessarily be taken as an expert. The scholar studies anything but his own customs, while an educated native is too inclined to embellish those customs, and present them in a form that would do credit to Justinian."
t0538 cite0160 MS14 "Charity Marriage . Another type of marriage, almost always performed with a fero, is called nyia sada’abe or marriage of charity. In such a union, most of the bridewealth and other marriage expenses are waived and the girl is given to the husband by those having authority over her marriage dispensation rights. In most cases, these marriages are with mallams or religious practitioners, and the marriage is considered an act of charity by the girl’s family bringing honor upon the family. Or again, a man may wish to express his gratitude to a mallam for supernatural aid having to do with medicine, prayers, or divination used by the practitioner for the benefit of the group bestowing the girl. In the same way, most individuals having power to bestow a girl would hesitate before refusing the request of a mallam because of the general awe in which he and his supernatural powers are held in the public eye. This is also a reason for not giving girls to mallams . For if anything should go wrong with the marriage and produce dissatisfaction on the part of the mallam, his powers of retaliation are very great."
t0539 cite0160 MS14 "Between the kwororam meeting and the wedding, the groom usually sends small presents to the girl and her close household relatives. In this period as well, he appoints his “best man” and “best woman.” The best man or so ba kura (chief friend) will act as his chief intermediary in making all arrangements with religious practitioners and other community members, as well as with the girl’s male relatives, especially her luwali . Both of these persons also arrange for messages to be sent to [Page 84] all relatives and friends of the groom telling the date and place of the wedding. Today in the city, this often means having invitations printed which are then sent out by messenger. The best man also arranges for the means of conveying the girl from her house to the groom’s. In rural areas, conveyance is by horse or camel. In the city, it is almost customary today to rent a car. The best man must also arrange for a special ceremony (the kolawa ) to be performed if this is the first wedding of the groom to a previously unmarried girl. The “best woman,” usually a senior female relative, often a father’s sister, acts as his intermediary with the women participants. The reason given for these aides is that the groom must maintain calm good relations during this period. To carry out all of the necessary negotiations himself could easily produce conflict on his part which might adversely affect the orderly progression of events leading to the completion of the marriage ceremony."
t0540 cite0255 FF57 "TIV NOTIONS of payment elucidate the matter more fully. The English verb “to pay” covers two Tiv verbs: kimbi and nambe . If we oversimplify for a moment, we can say that kimbi means to pay for goods, while nambe means to pay for services. 3 Within the subsistence sphere, I kimbi a bundle of guinea corn for a hoe, or I kimbi spinach greens for mushrooms. Within the prestige sphere, I kimbi brass rods for a cow. But, still within the prestige sphere, I nambe the akombo practitioner who performs rites for my benefit though I kimbi him (or anyone else) for the medicine he gives me. Within the marriage sphere of exchange the word kimbi is never used. I nambe my wife’s guardian by giving him rights in my ward. If I do not have a ward, I nambe him in brass rods until I have a daughter to give him as his ward, thus ensuring that I nambe him properly."
t0541 cite0041 AD05 "The suitability of the match is decided by matching the horoscopes of the two young people, either by consulting a specialist in the city or by presenting the horoscopes at the village temple and soliciting an opinion from the village gods. If the answer is favorable, the families begin negotiations in earnest, with each stage in the negotiations marked by an exchange of gifts. The engagement is formally marked by an exchange of rings as well as the sending of a small sum of money to the girl's family. If the girl's family has wealth, the boy's house also sends some ceremonial cakes; if her family is poor, this is usually ignored. The matchmaker receives her first fees at this point: about $ 60 NT from the boy's family, and $ 40 NT from the girl's family."
t0542 cite0175 AD05 "If the young people do not turn down the match after their formal introduction, and the two families find nothing prejudicial about each other, the next official step is “exchanging the eight characters.” The year, month, day, and hour of birth of the boy and the girl are written on red cards and exchanged. Each family places the card it received from the other family on its ancestral altar for three days to obtain the opinion of the family's ancestors and any gods who might be on the altar. A negative opinion is expressed by the death of a domestic animal, a family quarrel, an illness, something being broken or lost, or any other minor or major domestic tragedy. If either family decides for any reason that it does not wish to continue negotiations, a dropped rice bowl provides a simple solution that cannot offend anyone. There are still families who take such portents very seriously, keeping a complete record of any unusual events during this period, carefully questioning their meaning with the help of a fortuneteller, the priest in the temple, and inquiries of the gods on their domestic altar. If nothing untoward has happened at the end of three days, the girl's family takes both sets of eight characters to a fortuneteller to discover from his calculations how well suited the couple are to each other. Knowledgeable and cautious families have corrected in so far as possible any “errors” of birth that might make it difficult for their daughter to marry, changing the time or date to a more agreeable combination. But there is little they can do about a girl born in the Year of the Tiger, which makes her dangerous to people in particular ritual states, or in, say, the “broken months” (the third, sixth, and ninth), which indicate that her carelessness and clumsiness will bring endless small misfortunes to those around her. Moreover, even a family that has [Page 118] managed to register its daughter's birth on a good day in a good month at a good hour may find that her characters combine badly with the boy's, or that if she marries in this, her nineteenth (or whichever), year, she will bring on bad luck. One young woman we knew in Peihotien idly visited a fortuneteller only to be told that because she was so pretty she must either marry before she reached nineteen or “pay her flower debt” by working as a prostitute for a set number of years. Needless to say, her mother found this reading entirely unacceptable (the girl was aproaching her twenty-first birthday) and hurried her off to a more agreeable fortuneteller, who discovered alternative ways of “paying the flower debt.”"
t0543 cite0175 AD05 "When the negotiations are nearly complete, the eight characters [Page 125] are again submitted to a fortuneteller or other specialist to calculate a date that is “fortunate” for both parties. This is, incidentally, another reason why girls born in the Year of the Tiger or on other “bad” dates are such a nuisance. Not only are they in some cases a ritual danger to others, they also have so few “good” days that it is difficult to find a day on which they can be safely engaged, married, or even buried. I suspect that the go-between often uses the setting of the date for the engagement ceremony as a ploy to accelerate lagging negotiations and soften up firm positions taken by either or both sides."
t0544 cite0256 NA12 "Matrilineal kinship is most important today in ritual, in marriage, and in symbol. Ritual involves the clan unit and clan heads take active, or at least, titular command. This is the only area where the traditional “chiefs” publicly take precedence. All the current “chiefs” and leaders, who have not formally taken the position of “chief,” are men and the position is seen as a man’s position. Women take active [Page 204] part in the organization and execution of all clan events but do not take the “chief’s” role. No chief holds town or association office but they do support individuals for office. Their influence even here is that of the individual rather than that of the position of chief. The individuals holding positions as chief, are characteristically different than those holding modern political office. The chiefs are usually older men and specialists in the customs and attitudes of the “old tradition.” Their major skills are organizing a potlatch and making wise traditional judgements in leaborate speeches. The modern politician, on the other hand, is a younger person and must be knowledgeable in Western-type skills such as use of Robert’s Rules of Order and finding and getting federal and private grants. The two types of leaders live side by side and show mutual respect. Their areas of interest and influence are quite different. In marriage selection, the rules of matriliny still have some power. It is the rule of moiety exogamy, rather than the leadership of clan elders, which operates here. Symbolically, matrilineal terms are widely used. As often as not, however, they are used to symbolize the unity of the Tlingit people, rather than the division into matrilineal units."
t0545 cite0132 OI08 "[Preceded by descriptions of myths, taboos about naming after dead people, and sacred locations and historical knowledge.] All this is absolutely critical for the understanding of Western Aranda land ownership and cultural identity, since the same sacred sites that embody the dead as totemic ancestors also act as markers of countries. In any particular country there is a network of sacred sites and tracks made by several ancestral beings. For example, the Ellery Creek district, as it was defined and owned at the turn of the century was crossed by many ancestral tracks, including the major honey-ant track that came from Ljaba, outside of the Ellery Creek district in the north, then proceeding along Ellery Creek to Roulbmaulbma. Several lesser sacred sites lay along Ellery Creek to mark events from the honey-ant dreaming--places like Udepeta, Indotupa, Inbirilawuraka, Ntjankerama and Pmokoputa. In addition to these, there were sacred sites at Ragatia, commemorating the deeds of rain ancestors; Lalatuterelelaka, Tala and Alkuta Kara, commemorating events in a carpet snake story; and Alkutnama, the original mythical home of two cannibalistic eaglehawk brothers. Many other sites and tracks lay within the Ellery Creek district, but what made them belong specifically to that district was that the most secret and sacred knowledge pertaining to the myths was predominantly owned by an identifiable patrilineal clan consisting of men and women who held their [Page 34] knowledge by inheriting it from their fathers and paternal grandfathers and by having this inheritance reinforced by conception at local sites."
t0545 cite0132 OI08 "On the other hand, this distribution of knowledge was not even: some male members of the group ( pmaragatnia ) knew more than others; some of the children of the female members of the group ( kutungula ) knew more than others; and a few members of the group knew relatively little, actually knowing more about other countries, to which they felt themselves more [Page 35] attached. This illustrates a very important point about the constitution of the Western Aranda: no person belongs to any particular country simply by being conceived or born there, or by being related to people who previously held that country. Rather, belonging to a country is also a function of the possession of knowledge--and knowledge is not transmitted by conception or genetic inheritance, but by various media of communication. Moreover, this communication takes place in an elaborate and complex political field, with knowledgeable elders picking, choosing and favouring their main heirs to the disadvantage of others, who may thus become less powerful or influential people, or who may attempt to capitalise on their nominal rights in other areas. The fact that ownership of countries is based largely on religious ideas and links of kinship and marriage does not mean that it lies beyond political negotiation and competition. Indeed, it is quite evident that kinship networks, marriage alliances between families, and religious ideas and values are the very stuff of politics among the Western Aranda."
t0546 cite0110 OT11 "Payment is made to the tattooer. It is termed te fakakai [unknown]a tau , ‘the sharpening of the tattooing,’ [Page p. 176 (b)] and is regarded as a recompense for the work involved. Each day that the tattooing takes place the immediate kinsfolk of the patient prepare the oven and carry food to the house of the expert, with some areca nut or tobacco. When the work is done the patient goes and cultivates for a day in the orchard of the expert, making him a present of this labour. A ritual gift of the type known as maro is also prepared. It consists of a pandanus mat, a sheet of white bark-cloth, a piece of orange bark-cloth and a number of pieces of ordinary bark-cloth--ten or so."
t0547 cite0257 SQ19 "In many ways, Roberto’s marriage reveals the political dimension of Makuna marriage. First, by being a powerful ritual specialist, Roberto had political influence and social prestige in society. Therefore, he could claim a woman in exchange for his ritual services. Secondly, he knew well that Eulalia was the only child of an old, widowed and remarried man in the headwaters area of the Goya stream. His name was Yose (416). He belonged to the numerically small Minowaringana sib. He had no close relatives and not a single, male sib-mate in the Komeña territory. Hence there was nobody to oppose Roberto’s claim or to defend Yose and his daughter’s interests. And Alberto, who indeed cared for Eulalia as for a proper sister, was indebted to Roberto and dependent upon his ritual services. So they could do nothing but accept the marriage. In this way, Roberto took Eulalia as his second wife and became one of the few polygynous men in the territory."
