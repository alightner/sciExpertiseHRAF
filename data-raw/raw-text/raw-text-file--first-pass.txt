The Azande believe that whatever the mode of death the real cause is witchcraft ( mangu) or magic, and that the spirit remains near the tomb until the duty of taking vengeance has been performed. Benge is consulted, and indicates who among the relatives shall observe the mourning taboos. It is again consulted, theoretically, in order to discover whether the death was due to witchcraft (black magic) or was the result of the dead man’s own misdeeds. If the latter it signifies that he was himself the culprit, in that owing to some malpractice—adultery, theft, or black magic of his own performance—he has fallen the victim of someone else’s protective magic, lawfully used: has in fact been killed by his own misdeeds. But frequently it is found that the death is due to the black magic of some envious person, and then vengeance is a duty. The person selected as avenger is given likipwo; this consists of some bark cloth worn by the dead man, together with nail-parings, hair, and sometimes in the old days a joint of the little finger. The avenger calls in someone with knowledge of the magic of death, really an expert, who may have learnt the magic from his father or even bought it. This man takes the likipwo, burns it, and places the ashes in the mouth of a magic whistle, which he blows, uttering a spell against the murderer. The whistle and some bagbuduma medicine are then hidden in the bark of a tree. The avenger is also given a magic whistle to blow and utter spells over by the medicine man, to whom he pays a spear for his services.

The avenger, now subject to many taboos, awaits the effect of the magic. Someone is sure to die in the vicinity within the next few weeks and the relatives will consult benge to determine whether this death is the result of their magic. If the reply is in the negative the avenger must suffer his taboos until someone else dies and an affirmative answer is given. When the victim of the magic is dead the medicine-man is again summoned in order that he may provide an antidote to the magic, which may otherwise fall upon the avenger and kill him also. The relatives eat the antidote and make over to the expert valuable presents, including several spears, also providing him with food and drink. The latter goes to the bush, takes the magic from the tree, and casts it into water to destroy its power.

At times an affliction may be seen as resulting from a previous social situation of the afflicted person—for instance, a wrong done by him to another—and it is concluded that the aggrieved party is using magic against him and will have to be sought out and asked to desist. If a man who is working vengeance magic for the death of a kinsman falls ill, his relatives will conclude that he has broken one of the taboos necessitated by his position and that his magic has turned back upon him. 38

Illness may also be attributed to seeing cats—in which case a witch-doctor specializing in anti-cat magic is called upon.

Many people say that the great majority of witch-doctors are liars whose sole concern is to acquire wealth. I found that it was quite a normal belief among Azande that many of the practitioners are charlatans who make up any reply which they think will please their questioner, and whose sole inspiration is love of gain. It is indeed probable that Zande faith in their witch-doctors has declined since European conquest of their country, on account of the large increase in membership of the corporation. In the old days only two or three men in a province used to function as witch-doctors, whereas to-day they number scores. I have noticed again and again in other departments of Zande magic that faith tends to lessen as ownership spreads. To-day a witch-doctor has little scruple about teaching as many pupils as he can obtain and charging them ridiculously small fees in comparison with old-time standards. Moreover, the same risk does not now attach to the profession as used to be the case, when an error of judgement might entail serious consequences. In the general cultural disequilibrium due to the social changes consequent on conquests and administration, belief in magic and witchcraft has ceased to function adequately, and witch-doctorhood tends to become more a pastime than a serious profession. Nevertheless, there are many evidences which show [Page 184] decisively that scepticism is not a new phenomenon. There is, moreover, no question of direct Caucasian influence here because such influence is very slight among those Azande with whom I was best acquainted. Also old men who are entirely free from such influence have expressed to me the same scepticism about witch-doctors. Thus my old friend Ongosi used to tell me that most of what the witch-doctors told their audiences was just bera, just ‘supposition’: they think out what is the most likely cause of any trouble and put it forward, in the guise of an inspired oracle, as a likely guess, but it is not sangba ngua, the words of medicine, i.e. it is not derived from the medicines which they have eaten.

I particularly do not wish to give the impression that there is any one who disbelieves in witch-doctorhood. Most of my acquaintances believed that there are a few entirely reliable practitioners, but that the majority are quacks. Hence in the case of any particular witch-doctor they are never quite certain whether reliance can be placed on his statements or not. They know that some witch-doctors lie and that others tell the truth, but they cannot at once tell from his behaviour into which category any witch-doctor falls. They reserve judgement, and temper faith with scepticism.

It is evident that only a people imbued with a measure of scepticism could treat diviners in this manner. Only a people who understand that much of the power claimed by diviners is nothing but shrewd guess-work, coupled with professional dogmatism, could thus mock them. Yet Mbira believed firmly in every kind of magic, was, in fact, himself a magician of standing, and believed, moreover, in the particular kind of magic which gives prophetic powers to witch-doctors. When he was in trouble he summoned practitioners to his homestead and listened with respect to their words. He was convinced that [Page 187] some witch-doctors were genuine and could tell you their names. These genuine practitioners might make mistakes, but they possessed excellent medicines which gave them real prophetic powers, and, above all, they possessed mangu (witchcraft-substance). He believed that only those practitioners who are themselves witches can observe and control witchcraft. Only through Beelzebub can you cast out devils. This point of view is shown clearly in the text which I have recorded above.

I was some twenty months in Zandeland and was constantly associated with every kind of sickness. At one time I spent about two hours every morning dressing sores, but eventually I gave up this practice when I found that it took too much of my time. Major Larken supplied our settlement with a dresser who took my place. When, therefore, I generalize about Zande notions of disease, I do so on a fairly wide experience. I have invariably found that when a Zande is struck down by general and acute sickness, with sudden and severe symptoms and rapid course, as in certain types of fever, pneumonia, cerebrospinal meningitis, influenza, &c., his relatives and neighbours straightway connect his collapse with the primary cause of witchcraft or sorcery, almost always in cases of sudden collapse with sorcery. They do not say that the sick man is suffering from such-and-such an illness and that this illness is due to sorcery. The illness itself is diagnosed as bad magic—they say, when they see the symptoms, ‘It is kitikiti ngua,’ ‘It is sorcery.’ They immediately apply to a man who knows the antidote to the particular sorcery and ask him to administer it to the sick person. In the same manner it sometimes happens that a man thinks he has seen evil-bringing adandara cats in the bush, and if he falls suddenly sick within the next two or three weeks he [Page 507] will know that his sickness is due to their influence and ultimately to the woman who placed them in his path. The sickness, in fact, proves that he really did see adandara and that he did not imagine that he had seen them or mistaken some other cats for them. His relatives send for a specialist who knows the antidote to adandara if they do not know it themselves. Here again they may not name the sickness at all but simply say, ‘It is adandara’ (see Part I, Chapter III).

The dabtara, thanks to his knowledge of books and the lore acquired sub rosa while attending the church schools, wields many more powers than does the [unknown]tanquay . He can write amulets to keep away sickness and evil spirits. He knows formulas that can protect one from bullets and instill insatiable passion in the breast of one’s beloved. He has the power to bring rain or make it stop, and to plague the householder by turning all of his possessions against him. Like the [unknown]tanquay, his expert knowledge of plants and herbs can heal the sick or poison the client’s enemy. His superiority over the [unknown]tanquay is shown by the different manner in which he arranges a divination: he consults his heavy books, brews and interprets leaves, and then writes out his predictions on paper. For all this the dabtara’s fees are usually higher, but his status is perhaps more precarious, for he is after all a man of the church. The peasant feels none too easy in dealing with one who both serves the church and deals with devils.

The basic concepts and practices of Amhara medicine can be traced to ancient Egypt and the ancient Near East and can also be attributed to regional ecological links within Ethiopia. Often no sharp distinctions are made between bodily and spiritual ailments, but there are special occupations: the WOGGESHA (surgeon-herbalist) is a pragmatist; the DEBTERA (scribe) invokes the spirit world. The latter is officially or unofficially linked to the church, but the ZAR cult is apart and may even be female dominated. Its spirit healing has a complex cosmology; it involves the social status of the patient and includes group therapy. The chief ZAR doctor is often a matriarch who entered the profession when she herself was possessed by a spirit; she has managed to control some powerful spirits that she can then employ in her battles to overcome the spirits that possess her patients. No cure is expected, only control through negotiation and appeasement of the offended spirit, in the hope of turning it into a WEQABI (protective spirit). By contrast, possession by an evil spirit is considered more serious and less manageable than possession by a ZAR, and there is no cult. An effort is made to prevent it by wearing amulets and avoiding persons, who are skilled in trades like blacksmithing and pottery making. Since these spirits are believed to strike beautiful or successful persons, such individuals--especially if they are children--must not be praised out loud. If a person sickens and wastes away, an exorcism by the church may be attempted, or a TANQWAY (diviner- sorcerer) may be consulted; however, the latter recourse is considered risky and shameful.

Like the debtera, the wegesha is often an expert herbologist, called akk’abe s[unknown]ray (lit. who knows or keeps the work of nature). While walking in the bush, along brooks in the valley or in the dega upland, he notices and remembers the locations of plants and roots, which supply him with much of his pharmacopeia. His sense of direction is trained, and therefore seems uncanny to the layman. Moreover, not infrequently he actually transplants certain wild plants, so that he can always find them; these are located sufficiently far from residential habitations so that they are not easily found or consumed by cattle or disturbed by playful boys. A good rule for distance is how far the crowing of a rooster can be heard: some plants are believed to lose their magical power if disturbed by this sound.

The prophylactic measures [of an evil eye attack] include invoking God’s name every time a compliment is given, shaving of children’s heads, guardedness and social distance, cross-sex address, and the wearing of magical medicines and charms. The best curative after a strike has been made is to find the buda responsible and force him to confess and withdraw the curse (usually at gunpoint). A competent wizard may also be able to manufacture a counteractive medicine that will affect a curse.

--p
The co-operation of spirits can be obtained (1) mechanically, through spells, prayers, rites (C.1, C.2), and sanctified healing waters ( tebel, C.1); or (2) personally and directly, when a debtera forces a demon into his presence and compels his assistance, or when a shaman allows a zar spirit to possess her.
The nature of the connection between spirits and numerological instructions, special objects, and astrological-numerological reckonings (B.2,3,4: a [Page 247] combination especially used in preparing medicaments) is not understood by lay folk.
E. Knowledge of magic is always privileged. The ability to tap the power of spirits may be general (prayer to the spirits of the church) or privileged. Knowledge of magic and privileged access to spirits is distributed among four categories of people: herbalists, ecclesiastics, shamans, and debtera . Most herbalists incorporate some magic (B.1,2,3, but never B.4) into their recipes. The rural herbalist is usually a farmer, indistinguishable from his fellows except for his curing. He is known to his public by his ability to treat a specific, named ailment, and his professional title indicates only his disease name specialty and his degree of proficiency, e.g., “expert curer for body ulcers.” Few herbalists offer therapies for more than three or four ailments. Magical directions are specific for each cure and are inherited with it. Any ecclesiastic can annoint sick people with sanctified healing waters. A shaman persuades zar familiars to provide information and influence other sickness-causing zars. Debtera who have special powers can be either “demon-pullers” ( ganel sabiy ), whose powers come from demon familiars and magic (B.1-4), or minor debtera ( tinish debtera ), whose powers come from magic only.
F. The kinds of people who hold these special powers are distinguished from one another according to the range and availability of their powers and the moral opprobrium attached to their practices and themselves. The annointer, the herbalist, and the zar shaman each aim for a single goal: to repel (A.2), retain (A.8), and divine (A.1), respectively. The shaman can also end sickness (A.3) for devotees of the zar cult. The debtera (particularly the demon-puller) works all ten goals (A.1-10) for any client. An important expression of the debtera ’s power is his ability to perform many different kinds of medical works—to predict, prevent, cure, and cause—for a great variety of ailments, particularly serious ones for which herbalist cures are rare and herbalist prophylaxes are absent altogether, and contingencies. According to ordinary Amhara, i.e., people who are neither ecclesiastics nor members of the zar cult, no opprobrium attaches to the works of the herbalist or the annointer, whose works are authorized by the church, and the works of the zar shaman are believed to be morally different rather than immoral. On the other hand, opprobrium does attach to the debtera because he is intimate with demons, some of his works are evil ( kifat ) and destructive (A.4), and he has committed serious sins ( badal ) against the church, aside from sorcery and intimacy with demons. ...
Laymen are more certain of the moral facts that explain the debtera ’s path to power than they are about the technological ones. The moral facts are set out in the following archetypal biography by which laymen describe the professional lives of debtera magician-healers. As they see it, the debtera begins his career as an ordinary farmer-priest, who performs in the mass in his natal parish. He is no different from his fellow priests, except for a weakness in his character which makes him unable to keep within the proscriptions of the priestly life. Eventually, it leads him to commit a serious moral offense ( badal ), after which he can no longer perform the mass. Most often, it is adultery that spoils the priest’s identity. The theft of church tithes is another frequently mentioned act. Once discovered, he finds it impossible to continue his life in the parish. He is filled with shame; he is scorned by kinfolk and neighbors; and he loses his usufruct to church lands. But how is such a man to support himself once he has left the parish? Since his only resources now are his ability to read and write Amharic and Ge’ez (the language of the church) and his knowledge of the liturgy, he takes up a solitary wandering life as a debtera . His flawed nature gives him no peace, however, and he progresses from sin to sin until at last he seals his perdition by seeking the help of demons. At this point, he begins his career as a great magician, sorcerer, and healer. While no layman knows precisely how a debtera makes his contract with demons, it seems certain that the bond is sealed by an act of sacrilege and rebellion in which the debtera betrays the teachings of the church. ... In the case of debtera, it seems that the Almighty is usually unwilling to postpone retribution until the afterlife, and errant debtera are likely victims for a variety of stigmatizing afflictions. Some are shrunken into achondroplasia, others are turned into humpbacks, some become blind, and others suffer withering of arms and legs. Most often, it is through the agency of the debtera ’s own familiars that the Almighty chooses to punish him.

In his role as magician, the t’enqway is called k’wama (from k’om[unknown] , he stood up), since he tries to identify the personality of the evil spirit from his abode; e.g. in the water of a brook, or a waterhole in the river, or under a certain tree, etc. The magician is also considered an expert on fire and lightning. When a person is struck by lightning, m[unknown]br[unknown]k’ , the priests consider it heavenly punishment, and in the past even refused to bury the victim in the churchyard; thus the t’enqway is called in. His treatment consists of moving the victim quickly to the fireplace - he regards fire and warm ashes as the counteracting principle. If a house is on fire in town, it is still believed that the magician, standing on the roof of a neighboring house with a mirror, can prevent the spreading of the fire by causing the flames to recoil.

A woman who excludes zar s from her disease etiologies assumes great vulnerabilities. Without zar familiars, she must build etiologies from the mortal intentions of sorcerers, poisoners, and ganel s. Against these agents, a woman can generally afford to raise only weak prophylactic defenses, and the cost of expert therapy (by an awakiy debtera ) is usually beyond her slender means. Unmarried townswomen are particularly vulnerable in this regard, since they are without interested mates to purchase necessary debtera therapy or to insist on etiologies consistent with the teachings of the Church.

But for serious trouble—when someone has been afflicted by a zar or infected by a buda —the folk wisdom does not suffice, and a specialist is sought. The tanquay, or “sorcerer,” is consulted for exorcising demons as well as for physical ailments. In treating a zar patient his task is to discern, by clever interrogation, what manner of zar is riding the patient and then to determine what sort of gift is required to propitiate this zar . For a patient who has been “eaten” by the evil eye, he may succeed in summoning the guilty buda —identified when the patient calls out his name during a trance—and inducing him to spit on his victim; or he may resort to such techniques as transferring the demon from the victim to the body of a chicken and then killing the chicken. The [unknown]tanquay has other supernatural powers. He can summon the devil to liquidate the enemy of a client. He can interpret dreams and predict the future. For this he boils coffee, burns incense, and, sitting on a white sheepskin with freshly cut grass spread about the room, speaks out whatever comes to him.

Counter to this conservative drag, on the other hand, is the peasant’s powerful desire for one basic change in his life circumstances, namely, the reduction of morbidity and mortality. Despite his idyllic conception of paradise and his frequent contention that life on earth is something of little value, the Amhara wants to avoid death. Even from the religious point of view he is [Page 90] motivated to live as long as possible: the monk wants to live longer in order to get closer to God by prayer, and the worldly man wants to live long enough to atone for his sins so that he may enter paradise. Health thus rates as one of the most important values. The expressions for greeting and farewell stress health. Most of the prayers and vows offered have to do with achieving health. Long, painful pilgrimages are made for cures, and much money is spent for the remedies of native practitioners and for amulets to ward off illness. This powerful desire for health and life operates as a lever to overcome the resistance to change.
Toward the bearers of new ideas designed to satisfy this desire for reduced morbidity and mortality, however, the peasant’s stance is suspicious and unsympathetic at the outset. He regards Ethiopians who have been educated by Westerners as contaminated by alien norms and beliefs. They appear to him as Ethiopians, but also as strangers—as “black faranj ”—with their European clothes and their unorthodox eating and smoking habits. He tends to distrust their motives, to suspect them of being out to take advantage of him in some way. And he resents their overt or implicit disparagement of his way of life, particularly his practices in so sensitive an area as sanitation.
Against such obstacles one cultural factor that serves to present the health worker as an acceptable agent of change is the Amhara peasant’s deference to the man of learning. The public health worker is in a position to inherit some of the awe felt for the learned dabtara, especially since the health teams operate out of centers which provide therapy as well as instruction, which gives them the benefit of association with the quasi-magical powers attributed to one who performs successful treatment. In addition, he can be aided by the Amhara peasant’s personal devotion to someone who has helped him and won his confidence. Whether this devotion can be stimulated depends, in the last analysis, on the character and resourcefulness of the public health workers themselves. Those who are able to communicate in a dignified manner with the peasants, who avoid dealing with them as an inferior and backward people, who refrain from flaunting the most important local norms, and who are on good terms with local authorities and respected men, have a substantial chance of being accepted after an initial period of suspicion and alienation. Thus it was that a Gojjami peasant, asked why some of the local people were hearkening to the advice of the public health team at Dabra Marqos, explained: “We have come to realize that what you tell us to do is for our own advantage, not yours.” Elsewhere in Gojjam, a similar response was the eventual issue of a more pronounced initial rejection of public health workers. In the village of Dajan doors were closed against a venereal disease team which was taking blood samples of the entire population for Kahn test analysis. Popular suspicion was voiced in a number of ways; the health workers were accused of selling blood, of being missionaries, and of otherwise trying [Page 91] to cheat the locals. The health officer in charge of the team then brought some of the objectors to the mobile laboratory, patiently explained what was going on, and how it would benefit the people. Before long word got around that these outsiders were not so evil after all, and the doors of Dajan opened.

Many ailments are regarded by the Amhara as closely interwoven in the body and spirit of the patient, and in fact, frequently no sharp distinction is made between bodily and spiritual ailments, so that the same illness may sometimes be treated by the surgeon-herbologist ( w[unknown]ge[unknown]sa ), and if not successfully cured, by the practitioner of exorcising magic, the debtera scribe, or the practitioner of sympathetic magic of the zar cult, or even the sorcerer, the t’[unknown]nk’way . Only the latter is considered illegal. However, a fairly clear distinction is made between organic ailments and functional ailments, and on the basis of whichever preliminary diagnosis is made, it is decided which practitioner to call in first.
The association of the debtera with the church has increased his activities in recent years from that of amulet-writer and herbologist to many of the functions of outright magic, particularly since the tenqway has become illegal. The debtera always seems to have enjoyed the highest respectability and trust of any of the practitioners, since (as in ancient Greece), his activity in the official religion is believed to extend over the ills of the body and over the world of the spirits. There is no philosophical basis for the development of medical systems among the Amhara, thus no reasoned system. Their medical concepts are pre-Galen, at most Aristotelian. The debtera have, or in some cases claim to have, books handed down from past centuries, containing secret formulae, recipes, pharmacopeia of an intermingled empirical and magical nature. They warn inquirers that the public revelation of these secrets would create great social dangers at the hands of the irresponsible.

Violent forms of possession may manifest themselves by aggression directed against the patient himself, such as beating himself, hitting the head against the wall, eating [Page 304] dirt, trying to climb the wall, wanting to run out at night to roam with hyenas. In some cases, if accompanied by nosebleed, or “weeping blood”, this is diagnosed as buda and becomes a case for the debtera practitioner. In cases of running amok, with aggression directed against others, it may be diagnosed as ganen (jinn) and be treated either by the debtera, zar doctor, or t’enqway sorcerer.

Amhara healer and layman use common sets of physiological and pathological notions; neither physiology nor pathology is conceived as a coherent body of knowledge in its own right, however. The Amhara does not often verbalize these notions, and, when he does, it is in ad hoc contexts, generally intrinsic to the selection of prophylaxis or the administration of therapy. Thus, set down on the following pages as discrete subjects, Amhara physiology and pathology appear as collections of relatively simple notions, and of limited explanatory power when compared with the medical systems of other historical civilizations. Unlike those systems, the organization of Amhara medical beliefs and practices is dominated by concepts of practitioner power, its sources and its therapeutic and prophylactic expressions.

Such differences of opinion [about magical vs. natural etiology, which can look identical regardless of pathogenic agent and whether or not it was done intentionally by an agent] are generally of little consequence, for they have neither real therapeutic significance nor importance in non-medical contexts. Practitioners are chosen on their record of success (as well as their availability and cost), rather than according to any ‘theoretical’ criteria. Thus a scabies sufferer may obtain the services of a yimic medhaniyt korac (lit., “medicament outter for gerifta”) even though he believes, in the abstract at least, that the ailment is produced by likift . Most herbalist-names signify only the ailment which the therapist treats (e.g., the yianfula medhaniyt korac , treats anfula ), and the client may not know the specific etiological details to which the practitioner subscribes. There is, however, an exception to the one etiology-one disease name identification: Almost any ailment can be explained as the result of ganel or zar attentions (etiology of type E), particularly if it is serious, chronic, unyielding to treatment, or exhibits aberrant symptoms. Some ailments (e.g., apoplexy) are explained only by reference to this type of etiology.

Where the introjected pathogen is the self-conscious agent found in etiology C (i.e., the buda ), the strategy remains essentially the same. However, the practitioner must, in dialogue with the disease agent, convince the buda to quit the sickman. To this end, the practitioner uses a fumitory offensive to the introjected agent. Ailments of type D etiology (i.e., mers , poison) impose a special requirement on the therapist. There are numerous toxic formulae, and, although all produce similar symptomatic [Page 26] effects, each is believed to be complemented by a unique antidote. Cure therefore demands that the poison be identified in order for the antidote to be obtained.

The dental wogey[unknown]sa is known as a “ yiters medhaniyt awlakiy ”. As with other wogey[unknown]sa -treated ailments, toothache can be traced to multiple causes, whose identification is only marginally important to the practitioner. Toothache is caused either by sun-borne gerifta or by an intrusive worm whose presence is made apparent by the caries it bores out. The ultimate and most successful therapy of the yiters medhaniyt awlakiy is extraction, with the use of European dental pliers. Because of the pain associated with this operation, laymen often [Page 40] use local applications of commonly known palliatives, until subsequent discomfort obliges them to consult a tooth extractor. 3 
In the abstract, these palliatives (distilled spirits known as arakiy and ginger root) are only effective against the intrusive worm, but in reality they are used even when evidence of the worm agent ( til ), i.e., caries, are not apparent.
In addition to simple toothache ( yiters himem ), gerifta may result in rheumatoid pain ( kurtimat ) in the cheek teeth and adjacent jaw, accompanied by swollen, itching gums. Although herbal poultices are available for this syndroms, only tooth extraction promises permanent relief. The yiters medhaniyt awlakiy also treats the newly irrupted teeth of year-old infants. The upper lateral incisors are believed to often cause infants severe pain, resulting in incessant crying, diarrhea and failure to suckle properly. To remedy this dangerous situation, the practitioner removes the offending teeth using an awl-like implement. In each of these dental operations, kusil is considered no real danger, and prophylaxis is not given.

The cupper is unique among lay practitioners in several respects. First, he occasionally works under the direction of another category of practitioner, the tagan ( wogey[unknown]sa ). Second, there are special physical requirements; the agamiy must have all of his incisors, and the upper and lower teeth must meet in an unbroken plane. Third, the agamiy exposes himself to certain dangers in the performance of this therapy. Because he must remove a pathogenic substance through the medium of the sickman’s blood, there is the danger that, should any of the blood enter his own mouth, the agamiy may himself fall ill with the ailment he is treating. In addition, contact with this blood threatens those chronic ailments from which the sickman suffers (such as the rheumatoid pains associated with kitin , syphilis).

The type of practitioner that a client consults influences the final etiology with which his disease episode is finally rationalized. In the context of category three ailments, the awakiy debtera is a morally correct choice for the male client, since his therapy is capable of translating the disease episode into a confirmation of the client’s normative social state. Failing more innocuous indications (generally involving ganel s), the debtera ’s diagnosis and cure are expected to support an etiology of sorcery or poisoning. This marks the sick-man as someone’s talat ; a man someone wishes to kill or maim in retribution or fear; a man who has incurred a talat ’s interest by demonstrating aggressive and proud (i.e., masculine) behavior, by committing assault and murder, by usurping land rights, or by contesting sexual access to women.

Shortly afterwards, the king caught a very painful disease which made his legs swell. This was the cause of the disease: One day while he was at his capital of Nyanjeradde, Kinyolo told him of a lame but very expert doctor. “If I fetch him,” claimed Kinyolo, “he will cast such a powerful spell against Kakungulu, that he will never invade Buganda again.” When he heard this, Semakookiro sent Kinyolo to Buzongola to fetch the doctor. “The king wants you,” Kinyolo told the man on his arrival at Buzongola. The doctor accepted the invitation, but he also proposed that before he could go to Buganda with Kinyolo, they would first of all make a blood brotherhood. 10 
So as to protect himself against betrayal.
As soon as it was made they left for Buganda and on their arrival, the doctor gave the king a fetish and declared: “Kakungulu will never invade Buganda again because I have cast a spell against him.” After giving this fetish to the king, Kigulu the doctor asked for leave to return to his own country. But before he left, the king told Kinyolo: “You must drown him in the lake, lest Kakungulu hears of him and consults him also.” At first Kinyolo refused to kill his “blood brother”, but the king threatened him that, should he refuse, he must never return to Buganda. Because of these threats, Kinyolo agreed to drown the doctor and when they reached the river Kagera, he was thrown in and got drowned.

When a man fell sick, his wife immediately consulted the nearest medicine-man, who came, and by consulting the oracle was able to tell what was the cause of the sickness, and also to prescribe for the patient. If he was suffering from headache only, the usual remedy was to bleed him, in order to relieve him of the alien matter introduced into his head by means of magic, or by some ghost. When the cup was removed, the blood was poured into a leaf, and examined by the medicine-man, who invariably found something which had been drawn out in the cupping-process to account for the headache. The method of cupping was to apply one, and sometimes two cups, as the case demanded: these were short ends of horns, generally the tips of cows’ horns about three inches long; at the tip a small hole was made, to create a vacuum. The medicine-man shaved the hair from the side of the head, if he meant to cup the head; washed the place with [Page 100] water; took a sharp knife and made a number of scratches or slight incisions; again wetted the place over the scratches, applied the cup to the head, and sucked out the air, having in his mouth a little plug of leaf or grass, which he put into the hole, while still sucking out the air. For headache he usually cupped in two places, one on either side of the head. Cupping was practised for headache, for coughs (when they cupped the lungs on the back), for deep seated abscesses in the arms and legs, and sometimes for pleurisy in the side. The horns were left on the patient, until the medicine-man thought that he had drawn enough blood. In other kinds of illness the medicine-man who threw the pieces of leather was consulted, and prescribed for the patient. ... The remedies applied were often herbs which skilled medicine-men had found useful, for though a medicine-man worked magic, yet he also administered drugs, and did his utmost to relieve the sick person, and to retain his own reputation as a doctor. In some kinds of illness it was thought advisable to apply a small burning iron, made of three pieces of iron about a quarter of an inch thick and four inches long, which were welded together at one end, and pointed to a spike fitting into a wooden handle, so that it could be put into the fire, and made quite hot, and applied to the place where the pain was. Three blisters were usually made, which were supposed to give relief, and above all to drive out the cause of the pain. For fever the medicine-men administered herbs, which had to be drunk from one of the fetiches; this was said to increase their potency. Phthisis was always said to be caused by the ghost of some ancestor who had died of the complaint, and unless the ghost could be propitiated, it would kill the patient. The expectorations from such a person were greatly dreaded as being a channel for the [Page 101] ghost’s malign influence over any one who came into contact therewith.

When a man’s wife, or one of his children, was ill, he would sometimes take the fetich Nambaga outside his hut by night, and, holding it in one hand, would smoke upon it furiously, until the fetich possessed him, and gave him information as to the cause of the illness, and the treatment which he ought to adopt. Only the most skilled medicine-man could make fetiches; herbs had to be carefully selected, and other materials were needed, such as the hearts of lions, leopards, crocodiles, elephants, buffaloes, and other animals, which (it was supposed) would make the owner brave and strong. These materials were pounded together and stuffed into the horns, or they were mixed with clay, made into fetiches, and dedicated by the medicine-man to different gods. They thus became identified with a supernatural being, and in consequence they were possessed by the gods, and were powerful and effective. The secret of making these fetiches was confined to a small number of medicine-men who never divulged it to others, unless they themselves were to reap some benefit by the communication. The people believed that these objects had supernatural powers, they paid large sums of money for them, and treated them with the utmost respect and reverence.

[During the initiation of the prophet] the prophet was first marked out for his career by the choice of the lubale, manifested in his possession by the spirit, but he could not begin to prophesy till he had been ceremonially initiated by an older practitioner. The usual signs of possession by a lubale were different from those of possession by a muzimu . The person concerned “ went mad ”, wandered about in a distraught manner, and slept out of doors. It was also possible, especially in the case of a child, for an illness of any kind, which ordinary means failed to cure, to be interpreted as due to this cause. The theory seems to be that the lubale, having selected a person as its mouthpiece, becomes angry when he does not prophesy and tries to kill him, and that the illness is the result.

The Baganda do not, as a rule, believe that there is a western medicine for treating epilepsy, because it is a Kiganda illness. Out of 83 cases of epilepsy whom I saw in the rural area, only eight had tried to obtain some help from western medicine. Out of these only two had understood the necessity for continuing the medicine indefinitely, but had been unable to afford to fetch it each month. Two others had obtained treatment from private practitioners and one from a chemist, but these had not understood that they needed to return for more. One had been in Butabika Hospital because of associated violent madness and another had attended the local dispensary and been asked to attend Mulago Hospital but had never gone there. The remaining case had got as far as attending [Page 46] Mulago Hospital but says he was told there that the medicine for this illness “was not easily obtained” and so came away empty handed. Most cases in fact had never even thought of getting western medicine, while others were quite emphatic that, up to my coming, there had never been medicine available. I heard of a few instances in which there was a definite feeling against trying to get western medicine. It was difficult to trace such cases and the reasons for such an attitude can only be surmised. Shame and the possibility of ridicule at being turned away without treatment are more likely to be a reason than fear that such an action may anger any spirits causing the illness.

Girls' Initiation .--Among the Masai girls are initiated singly and not in groups, nor are they initiated until a good many years after puberty, for as soon as a girl is initiated she must be married, and cease to have any intercourse with the warriors or boys. Except under the circumstances described above, a girl is not initiated until her breasts begin to droop to a marked extent. As soon as this is noticeable, her mother informs the father, who makes the necessary arrangements. If the girl's mother is living at the time at a manyatta with one of her sons, then the girl's initiation will take place at the manyatta , otherwise it will take place at the home village. The essential point is that initiation must take place in the mother's hut (or in the hut of another of her father's wives, should her own mother be dead). The father comes to the place when the day of the ceremony has been fixed and beer is prepared. A ram called olekelnjatha is slaughtered either before the actual operation or just after it. This is the “ram for childbearing,” and is supposed to insure fertility. This ram is eaten by all those present at the ceremony. The actual operation is performed by an old woman, who is a skilled operator (she may be either a Masai or a Dorobo), and the girl sits on a skin inside the hut during the operation. The operation is said to be the same as that used by the Kikuyu on their girls, and this is a form of clitoridectomy, but exact details cannot be obtained from the men. As soon as the operation is over the operator washes the girl to “cleanse her of the blood spilt” and a ram is then slaughtered and given to the operator. This ram is called oletuguet . Next a ram is killed called olkelelarlat to provide meat and fat for the girl during convalescence.

The ordeal for the initiate begins from the time that he is made aware of the possibility of flinching as a painful thought. He has years to prime himself for something that can never quite be known until it has been experienced. This is the third source of anxiety and it also bears on the fate of the circumciser who faces a different ordeal. It is believed that if no boy [Page 73] flinches in the course of a season of initiations, then the circumciser will meet an early death. This is one reason why no Maasai would normally accept the task, and it is usually undertaken by a skilled man from elsewhere who is prepared to take the risk. He is despised as a scavenger, a dorobo , whose greed for the payment outweighs his prudence. It is therefore in his interest to retain a reputation for skill, while making this a painful operation in the hope that he may snick some hidden nerve and cause an involuntary twitch. Technically, the initiate would have flinched even if someone inadvertently nudges him, and his kinsmen are said to watch the operation very closely: the initiate for signs of a twitch, the circumciser for some dirty trick, and any spectator close by who might nudge him. Sometimes they may even form a close protective ring round the operation to keep possible ill-wishers at bay (cf. Fox 1931:191).

Much specialized botanical and meteorological knowledge is conserved in traditions specific to each region of the country. Virtually every nomadic clan has its recognized weather-lore experts (cilmicurraaf) . These are usually older men who have inherited knowledge of astronomy, meteorology, and animal husbandry from their forebears and who, during their own lifetimes, keep records of drought, rainfall patterns, and the changing qualities of the grazing areas [Page 44] frequented by their kinsmen. Their advice is often encapsulated in poetry or sayings of the following sort:
If the gu rains fall
And are successful,
My herd should be taken
To the red sand country
Which is best for grazing. 6

The weather-lore expert also calculates the arrival of certain propitious times such as dambasamo, the night in the middle of autumn when the rams are let loose to mate with the ewes. Lambs conceived on that night will be born about 150 days later, which should be in the middle of the gu (spring) rains.
Although most of the calculations of the weather-lore expert are grounded in experience and empirical observation, he is also usually something of a forecaster and astrologer. The following saying from the Mudug region of central Somalia is typical of the expert’s predictions:
The year of the successful rains is that in which Dirir [the star Arcturus] is slightly behind the moon in the early part of the night but in which the two become parallel in the sky throughout the second half of the night. In the calculus of pastoral decision-making, the weather-lorist is frequently consulted and his wisdom highly regarded. His expertise helps insure that nomadic groups are operating in an environment that has been well-charted by experience and tradition.

This method [of computing lunar months], quite ingenious, as is seen, is, however, only the popular one. It serves for the current use of the Bedouins, who are able to be sufficiently well informed on the whole about the beginning of the season of the rains, when they do not want or are not able to have recourse to the wad[unknown]ad, expert on the stars for the tribe, for advice. This combination, then, in the reckoning of the Mussulman calendar with the Somali one is noteworthy, since it demonstrates, on the one hand, the continuous diffusion of Islamic culture, and, on the other hand, the practical reasons for which the Somali solar year remains in use today.
The method by stellar observations is more complex; it was easy to get information, because it is a part of the ‘knowledge of the tribe,’ which, however, is threatened more every day by the progress of Islam.

On the other hand, it is necessary to consider that this method of the Migiurtinis is used by the wadâd of the tribes, as I said at the beginning, and the divisions of the year for such a purpose are known only by the ‘star experts’ in the tribes, whereas in the common usages of life -- within the solar year -- the dates are fixed by the lunations, which have -- in turn -- Somali names. Thus, for example, within the solar year that goes from one ‘feast of fire’ to another, none of the Migiurtini fixes a date indicating it, as, let us say, the 5th 222 of musarêmo or the 7th of fu[unknown]sádi, but rather one sooner speaks of the fifth day, for example, of the lunation of sidetâl (= [unknown] [unknown]) or of the fourth day of the lunation of dágo (= [unknown]). It is understood, on the other hand, that the learned man who wants to calculate the beginning and the end of the rains must know the correspondence between the days of the lunation and those of the periods of the solar year.
Now in this state of things it seems not improbable that the ancient division of the solar year into groups of decades, which has fallen out of use among the tribes and continues to be used only by the “star experts,” has been partially perfected by the latter with those new divisions based on direct stellar observations, which form the second half of the actual solar year of the Migiurtinis. But it is not easy to find a precise solution for this little problem, since it also might be that the two systems (year divided into groups of decades and year calculated on the occultations of Spica) have in the past coexisted integrally -- the one as a popular system and the other one as learned system -- and that then, both driven back (I shall speak thus) into the limited field of the ‘knowledge of the tribe,’ they have been combined into the present method of the Migiurtini “star experts.”

[My beautiful camels,]
The readers of the HAYDHO 1 ,
Who is also the expert on stars,
Announces a long lasting supply of rainwater,
And an unexpected season of heavy rainfall...
I also heard a saying by an Arabian sheikh against what he considered the Somalis’ overdependence on astronomy... If sheep start to give birth
At the setting of the Pleiades constellation,
But the life-giving SEERMAWEYDO rain [by chance] fails
to come,
What would the foolish Somalis do?
The Somali argument against this preaching was as follows:
“We believe in three different kinds of teaching:
a) CILMI-WADAAD, the teaching of the religious sheikh;
b) CILMI-HABREED, the teaching of the Bush Nurse;
c) CILMI-CURRAAF, the teaching of the Bush-life expert.
[Page 2] 2
Refusal by us to obey the teaching of the religious sheikh will result in internal punishment. Refusal to obey the teaching of the Bush Nurse will result in loss of children. And refusal to obey the teaching of the Somali Bush-life expert [the astronomer] will result in poverty. [Therefore we have to recognize all these three teachings.]
And I recognized the many phrases in our language that closely associated the weather and the well-being of my people, as exemplified in the DABAYL-CAAFIMAAD, “breeze of health and tranquility.”

1. An astronomer,
2. An astrologer,
3. A pastoral geographer,
4. A mathematician,
5. A keeper of records of the study of weather lore (actually in his memory),
6. A meteorologist, and
7. A soothsayer.

In the first place, the weather lore expert knows fairly well the locations and paths of the major celestial bodies -- including the visible planets, the sun, the moon, and a large number of constellations and clusters of stars. The positions and changes of these bodies are interpreted in manners relative to Somali life. Some of these interpretations are astrological in nature. For example, the eclipse of the Moon is said to fortell the death of a renoun leader; and that of the sun, a prosperous year. Moreover, a child born on certain nights when the Moon is adjacent to certain stars is thought to be evil; yet if born on other nights, he is considered virtuous. But the greater part of the interpretations of these bush weather lorists is logical, and in many cases pragmatic. Their inductions are based on:
a) information handed down from past experts, for which they are the record keepers;
b) personal observation of the positions and changes of those celestial bodies.
In this way, then, the weather lore expert acts as a combination of astrologer and astronomer.

The weather lorist is also an expert on the grazing and care of animals--he is a pastoral geographer. He knows what areas are best for grazing at what time of year; he knows what grasses are best for the animals; and he knows what type of earth will support these grasses. He knows which wells give the best water for animals. He must be on constant watch against water that contains HHANFALEY (poison). 3 
. Somali pastoral veterinary doctors think the poison is caused by roots of certain plants making their way down into the water table. The most dangerous plant is called CADAY. This, interestingly enough, is the tree whose roots and branches are used throughout Somalia as toothbrushes. CADAY is found in salty or gypseous country.
On certain years, certain wells will contain HHANFALEY. The weather lore expert must keep record of which wells will be potentially poisonous each year. He knows this through keeping account of which flocks were lost, both where and when. He then goes to the well and tastes its water. If he is uncertain still, he will test the water with one goat. Still doubting, he will advise his kinsmen not to use the well at all. So the expert must be very conscientious in his role as a geographer.

The pastoral expert is also a meteorologist. He understands the winds and their changes, the rains and their sugnificant influences on the flocks of animals and on the lives of people, both nomads and agriculturists. One miscalculation by the weather expert can upset the Somalis’ entire way of life. If, for example, the special night of DAMBASAMO, when rams are permitted to mate with ewes, is miscalculated, the kids may be born at the wrong time of year. If they are born during the dry season, they as well as their mother may die for lack of grazing and water. In short, the weather lorist bears a lot of responsibility towards his kinsmen.

In calculating the HABEYNTIRIS, the weather lore expert’s role as a record keeper comes most into play. One of his most important services is to keep an accurate record of the calendar. In our research, we have discovered that the country falls into seven district regions. The experts of these weather districts have their own unique terminology describing the seasons and lunar months, as well as the Stations of the Moon, elaborated in an above section. The districts are numbered (1) to (7) in the map in Appendix 9.3.

Although burji is very loosely defined in daily discourse there are experts who have a more elaborate understanding of the concept. These are the religious specialists, the wadaado or culmadda . Burji is seen as a part of the area of competence of these men; i.e. the cilmi or religious knowledge. It is significant that this connection is made, because cilmi is conceived of as distinct from knowledge of worldly matters, kasmo or caqli . 4. Cilmi itself is of course far from uniform; as pointed out by Cassanelli (1975) there exists in the history of Somali Islam a distinct contrast between what he calls a mystical and a theocratic tradition. We will here only be concerned with the mystical tradition, the best general introduction to which is Lewis 1955/56.
Cilmi and kasmo , religious and mundane knowledge, belong to entirely separate spheres of thought and action. In two important papers, Lewis has analysed this dualism further within the contexts of notions of power and of role stereotypes (Lewis 1963, 1965). As he aptly summarizes his findings, Somali do not validate secular supremacy in religious or secular terms, but rather...see mundane and religious power as counter-poised, and... assume that one is present where the other is absent . [Lewis 1963:115, emphasis added]... I found that people had [Page 93] difficulty explaining the term other than by relating examples of it, often drawn from their own experiences. It was said: “when a boy falls in love with a girl but feels that something stops him from approaching her, then it is her burji that is bigger than his”. Similarly, I was told that “the one who can always persuade others to agree with his propositions, it is his burji that helps him”.

Having talked about what burji is not related to, I must turn now to what it is related to. There is a distinctly religious element to the notions concerning the individual. Not only is individual honour (in the sense described above) directly associated with religious values, but when asking questions about burji itself, most of my informants directed me to the religious experts. I was told that burji is a large and complicated concept but that those men who possess astrological knowledge ( xiddigis ), secret religious knowledge ( asraar or cilmi sireed ) and religious knowledge in general ( cilmi ) also have holy books where the secrets of burji are revealed.

The knowledge of burji possessed by the religious experts is indeed much more specialized and technical than that possessed by laymen. According to the experts there are twelve different, named burji . To find out which burji a person has, his name is written with Arabic characters and the position numbers assigned to each one of the characters within the Arabic alphabet are then added together. The sum reached is by further calculations made to correspond with the number of a burji ...
Burji is also connected with what was called “the small stars”. In Arabic they are known as manaazil and there are 28 of them. Each one of these stars is linked to one of the characters of the Arabic alphabet, and through this link, it was claimed, another connection between the name of a person and his burji can be established. The “small stars” are dependants of, or “soldiers of”, the seven “big stars” (in Arabic kawaakib ). These, in turn, are related to each one of the seven heavens, and they are also related to different prophets. Because of this latter link, a person can be informed about which one of the prophets is “his”. The 28 small stars can be further rearranged into four groups with seven stars in each. Each one of these four groups is [Page 98] related to one of the four seasons and, therefore, the different burji are linked to the seasons too. In addition, some of the experts are able to establish a connection between the burji of a person and a day of the week. Such days may be said to be the proper day to pursue various difficult tasks.

This system, then, is both enormously complex and suggestive of a fascinating system of cosmic correspondences such as that described for the northern Somali by Galaal (1968). It should be stressed, however, that none of the experts I consulted knew other than fragmentary bits of it by heart. Throughout the interviews they had to consult their documents and notes on the subject, and even so many questions remained unanswered. Furthermore, the answers I got from one expert frequently contradicted the answers of another. I should also mention that there were tendencies among the experts to make the subject even more “mystical” than it already appeared. For instance, all names of the stars and of the different burji etc. were consequently given in Arabic even for those that have Somali names. This shroud of obscurity and mysticism in which the knowledge of burji is dressed is of course particularly significant in view of the transparency of genealogical, agnatic knowledge. The property of obscurity may be seen as a semantically particularly powerful one. It can only be identified as such, however, when contrasted with non-obscure categories.

One of the many applications that the scholarly knowledge of burji has is to determine whether it is appropriate to marry a specific person. In such contexts one can observe how the fluidity of the system gives rise to a big variation in the interpretations offered. Sometimes the name of the potential wife will be used to derive a specific burji . It may be shown that this burji is related to jilaal , the dry-season, and is thus indicative of her possible infertility. In other cases, the sum of the wife’s name is subtracted from that of her husband. The result may be a “female” burji which may be taken to mean that the marriage, if it should come about, will only be blessed with daughters. On the other hand, the same burji may be related to the star qalbi , heart, a possible sign that the wife will love her husband dearly. I have also witnessed how the same basic facts are given a different interpretation on another occasion. [Page 99] These examples show that there are generous margins within this system of correspondences and the number of possible interpretations appears to be infinite. 
This applies not only to contexts of marriage, but one can note the very same tendencies of a “looseness” in the interpretations within every possible area of application. I am not the only one to make such observations. Many informants admitted that what the experts said did not always seem to be internally consistent. However, to them this fact underscored that burji is a complicated subject. Some people also took this opportunity to deliver a cautious criticism of the local experts by calling them kitaab gablow or Yaasiinleh , terms that imply that these men have only been taught a tiny fraction of the Koran. It is true that some experts I consulted did not enjoy a generous reputation for their learning. However, many of them were regionally recognized shaikhs, trained in Baardheere or in other reputable institutes of religious learning. The fact remains that detected inconsistencies only seem to amplify the belief that the system of knowledge concerning burji is one of obscure, hidden truths. As Simmel has suggested, the use of secrecy offers the possibility of a second world alongside the manifest world (Simmel 1950:330). The glimpses of truth believed to be contained in the fragmented knowledge of burji has an indisputable quality of such otherworldliness.

Discussing Somali medical plants, one should be careful not to underestimate the accumulation of practical knowledge which may underlie their use. Lewis writes that “in enquiring . . . why a certain plant was supposed to have curative powers . . . I was usually told that it had been tried and found to be efficacious” (1961:26-27). However, the use of plants is not confined to purely medical purposes. “Herbalists” are also thought of as knowledgeable about sorcery (sexir) . In Southern Somalia it is widely believed that the population along the river-valleys are particularly skilled herbalists. Those traditionally engaged in the ferrying across the river are held to possess a knowledge of herbs by which they control the wild animals such as crocodiles and hippos. These men, who are called baxaari, enjoy considerable recognition far beyond their home villages. Among the Hubeer these baxaari are regarded as belonging to the inferior groups of common (boon) descent, who are further described in the next chapter.

Few herbalists claim to master this method fully. It is generally believed that the method is mostly used by those endogamous social groups who are descendants of slaves or who are outcasts. The baxaari, whom I have mentioned, is such a group, but in every Southern Somali village there are groups or individuals with a corresponding social position. Just like the baxaari such people may have an inferior social position and be feared for their magical skills, although they are often only talked about as dhiryaqaan, “the one who knows about herbs”...
We should note here, then, that there is some connection between the lower levels of society and knowledge of medical plants. This does not imply that the plants as such are seen as belonging to these groups, nor that using plants for curative purposes is defiling, only that certain socially peripheral groups are often [Page 109] believed to be particularly skilled in handling them. A commonly held view on why it is precisely these groups that are knowledgeable in the use of plants, is that they allegedly are less religious than other Somalis, and that this has forced them to seek another type of knowledge. Lewis (1963; 1965) has also suggested that one can view these groups’ connection with sorcery as a kind of compensation for their lack of political influence.
It should be emphasized that although, at times, knowledge of the more esoteric usage of medical plants times is associated with the socially inferior, the plants themselves are seen as connected with the place where they grow. The spatial category duur, the bush, connotes the anti-social, the dangerous and the wild. The very word duur is used in constructions such as duurgelid, “to become completely mad”, and duur-xul, “to talk in an obscure way”. Duur is the sphere of the wild animals (dugaag) while domesticated animals (xoola) belong to the sphere of the village and “civilization” (ilbaxnimmo) . If a herbalist is consulted only to get advice on what plant should be used for a certain purpose, he will usually stress that the plant in question should be obtained from “a distant place” (meel fog ah) . In markets one finds surprisingly little commerce with medical plants. One reason, an informant suggested, is that they must be “fresh” (dhay) to have any “effect” - faa’ido . A guarantee for faa’ido is that the patient picks the plant himself or that the herbalist does it in connection with the treatment.
The latter method is also the most common one in cases where an expert is consulted. The expert himself supplies the patient with those plants or parts of plants that are needed in the treatment. If they require any form of preparation or extraction he will see to that too. The administration of the cure is also supervised by the herbalist. If repeated administration is necessary, the herbalist will usually stay overnight at the patient’s home or return there with the medicine when it is time. If he asks a direct question, the patient will usually be told the name of the plant being administered. However, experts will not volunteer such information and they frequently attempt to conceal the exact method of preparation. ...
In summary, knowledge about medical plants is to some extent linked with an inferior and dangerous social status. Furthermore, the plants are associated with the spatial category of duur, bush, and are seen as especially powerful when they come from distant places. I have also pointed out that there is a tendency to keep knowledge of medical plants to oneself. This fact would seem to contribute to the reproduction of the knowledge of geed as a distinct area of knowledge.

Turning now to the religion, diin, it should be observed that in religious forms of treatment there is a greater emphasis on the role of the expert than is the case with the herbal treatments. While there is a considerable amount of competence with regards to medical plants among laymen, people are more inclined to turn directly to an expert in cases where they prefer a “religious” cure for a disease.
The emphasis given to the religious experts does not only apply to contexts of healing. In Somali society there is a profound dichotomization of phenomena associated with religion and phenomena seen as profane or mundane. Ideally every Somali man is thought of as either a warranleh, a spear-bearer, or as a wadaad, a man of religion. In the same way religious knowledge, cilmi, is separate from knowledge of worldly matters, called dhuug or caqli . The religion is seen as providing a system of non-disputable norms which stand opposed to the worldly and debatable norms. Cultural and customary decrees (dhaqan) may be explicitly contrasted with what is required by the religion (diin) . To express that something is “compulsory” or khasab means [Page 111] that it is prescribed by the religion. In traditional courts one can also find conflicts about which set of standards should be applied: is the verdict to be given in conformity with the Islamic law ( sharciiya ) or should Somali customary law ( xeer soomaaliyeed ) be used? These facts form a necessary background for understanding the integrity of religious phenomena and the way in which “religion” is seen as an independent system (see Chapter 3).

A more advanced form of religious therapy requires greater knowledge. A distinct trait of the therapy offered by the more skilled experts is that people in general do not fully comprehend how they go about it, nor are they expected to. Advanced religious therapy is based on certain concepts of the individual which are called burji . As I have described in Chapter 4 this is the astral constellation a person is born in and it also implies that the person possesses a certain potential force. For curing disease, and also for curing conditions such as childlessness or to establish contact with the opposite sex, the task for the [Page 112] appointed wadaad is to alter the burji of the person so that the disease is defeated, or so that other desired effects result. Knowledge of somebody’s burji can be gained either by knowing his date of birth or by using the person’s name with the name of his mother added. If the latter procedure is chosen the names are written in Arabic and the position numbers assigned to each one of the characters in the Arabic alphabet are then added together. This sum is by further calculations made to correspond with the number of a particular burji .
This is about as far as a layman’s knowledge goes. The techniques that are then used for altering the burji remain known only to the specialists. Essentially, what the experts do is to utilize the links that the burji is believed to have with other phenomena. For instance it is held that a burji may be male ( lab ) or female ( dheddig ). Every burji is also connected with one or several of the seven skies ( todooba samadood ). It also has connections with the astral bodies, with the four elements and with different organs of the body. In brief, the notion of burji rests on the assumption of correspondences between various elements of the cosmos. Since I have already given attention to these aspects of the concept of burji (Chapter 4), I shall here repeat only the most central points: There is considerable discrepancy between the interpretations of burji given by different experts. The interpretations and the different calculations required are performed with the help of Arabic books and are regarded as a part of the “secret knowledge” called asraar or cilmi sireed . Depending on what books the expert has access to, the interpretation of a person’s burji will vary. It should also be noted that several of the symbols which appear in these consultations do not correspond to objects identified in other circumstances. The four elements, for instance, are not parts of Somali cosmology.
Another factor is the use of Arabic throughout the treatments, which confers a shroud of obscurity to the religious therapy.
The alteration of a person’s burji that one aims at establishing, is to some extent determined by the disease from which the patient suffers and in what part of the body it can be located (cf. note 1). In one case when a woman was suffering from pain in the chest, it was determined that it was her heart, the qalbi, that was causing the illness. The woman’s burji was calculated by an expert who also established a number for the star which bears [Page 113] the name qalbi . The number of the woman’s burji was added to that of the star and the sum reached was the number fifteen. He then drew a diagram of three by three squares and wrote an Arabic character in each square. The position numbers of these characters would add up to fifteen in each row of squares. On the same paper he then wrote the surah Yaasiin, which, as I have mentioned is the “heart” of the Qur’an. The paper was folded carefully and the woman subsequently had it put into a cover of leather, a xersi, to bear around her neck.

More importantly, the medicine itself derives its power from its links with categories that are opposed to the normal, mundane and known. Whether it is a matter of plants brought in from the wild, or of religious formulas informed by sacred knowledge, or of medicines manufactured by strangers, the efficacy of a treatment depends on the degree of such connections. A plant from a distant place is more powerful than one which grows close to the house-wall. A religious expert who possesses many holy books and can master an obscure religious idiom is more reliable than one who can recite only a few surahs. Similarly, the medicine brought from a distant country or distributed by a foreigner is preferable to that which is imported from Kenya or obtained from the local dispensary.

To recapitulate: a brief description has been given of the Cushitic world of power manifest in an apparently incoherent and rather vague hierarchy of refractions of the Sky God ( Waaq ). This world presided over by God comprises the phenomena which we call ‘natural’; the sun, moon, and stars, the winds, rainbow, rains, and the rest, as well as the more contiguous parts of nature, the hills, trees, and water, which make up man’s immediate surroundings. Certain configurations of these phenomena are fraught with power, available sometimes to ritual experts only, sometimes to whoever chances to cross their path. One of the tribal religious expert’s ( wadaad ) special skills is his knowledge [Page [p.28]] of the skies and power to interpret the movements of the heavenly bodies (Cerulli, 1929, 1931 (2)).

The Bemba cannot be described as a fishing tribe. As a food, fish makes one of their favourite relishes, and is reckoned nearly as great as meat. They catch fish whenever they can, and very much appreciate dried fish, but such food is regarded rather as a sudden piece of luck than as a regular article of diet, and fishing itself in a greater part of the country is an amusing pursuit, particularly when undertaken communally, rather than a serious means of getting one’s livelihood. Among the neighbouring Bisa, a fishing tribe living on Lake Bangweolu, each fish is known by name and referred to as such, and every child in the community is able to pick out the different sorts correctly from a heap. But among the Bemba, though different types are recognized by the older men, the rest of the natives just speak of ‘fish’. The Bisa regularly dry fish and trade it over the country. They have a fixed system of prices and reckon each catch carefully in terms of financial profit. The Bemba, on the other hand, only sell fish occasionally, at certain seasons of the year, and then by a process of casual barter. Apart from those who live by the banks of big rivers they are indifferent boatmen and handle clumsily the paddles of the dug-out canoes at river fords. Along the Chambesi, Luansenshi, and other big rivers there are, however, definite fishing villages recognized by the natives as such. These villages remain fixed in one position year in year out. Here we find fishing by one method or another going on all the year round, a complex system of ownership of weirs and rights of use of ponds, and special fishing ceremonies such as are not found over the rest of the plateau. The inhabitants of these villages are definitely specialist fishermen, distinguished by name as umulonga (plur. abalonga ) and considered very exclusive and even dour by the rest of the Bemba. The latter discuss the habits of these fishermen as though they were almost a [Page 330] race apart, although in reality they differ from other Bemba merely in regard to their fixed habitation, greater degree of intermarriage, and independence of their neighbours. It will be best to sketch fishing methods in general as they are practised all over the country, and then to describe the more complex type of occupation characteristic of these riverine villages.

In approaching Nyambe or his subordinates, skill and knowledge were important, for, as the myths of Kamunu suggested, they gave man what power he had in the face of a capricious god. The priest-guardians were specialists. Cunning and strength could enable a chief to seize ruling medicine from a supernatural being.
An ordinary man could acquire the characteristics of an animal by ‘drinking worms’ (maggots from the [Page 147] carcase of the animal desired). The worms would accept or reject him. If they accepted him, then after death he would become such an animal by metempsychosis, thus ‘defeating’ death.
Here the line between powers of the day and of the night was shadowy...
Nyambe was capricious. He radiated darkness and light. The world and all that happened in it eventually depended upon him. His world was full of resources which were therefore charged with positive or negative potentials, reflecting his nature. Jacottet's informants explained this graphically: nothing in the natural environment was neutral (which is not the same as animism). 31 Skill and faith were both necessary to manipulate the natural environment beneficially. Take the crucial commodity of rain. In their argument, the rainmaker had told Livingstone that ‘God alone can make rain, my medicines don't make it. But he has given us the knowledge of certain plants and trees by which we pray to him to make rain for us. We charm the clouds and he makes the rain for us.’ 32 Jacottet's informants told him of the powers of the ‘old man of the rain and thunder’ 33 and of the way that the royal ancestors could be beseeched to intercede with Nyambe to bring rain. The relationship was the same even if the methods were different. 34	
Birds, 35 animals, 36 roots and plants all had these dual potentials. Which was activated depended primarily upon the motive, contingently upon the manner in which they were approached. Human beings had the same potentials but they were controlled differently.
The professions of healer ( ñaka ) and of witch ( muloi ) were very similar in many of their ritual performances. Techniques of diagnosis and divination, of bewitching and of curing, were frequently similar, sometimes [Page 148] indistinguishable. Jalla was given the standard evasive answer in the 1890s: ‘According to the Lozi [sorcery] comes from the Mbunda, just like mwati ’ (vegetable poison, of which more below). The real distinction between witch and healer was one of motive expressed by certain ritual behaviour, and part of this sense was in Jalla's own observation that ‘the moloi (sorcerer) is someone who divines with evil intent [ jete des mauvais sorts ] -- the ngaka (doctors) are entirely different’

Liñaka (healers) who were appropriately skilled could provide protective medicines that would prevent bewitchment. Such medicines were, and are, highly prized. However, the danger was that the healer consulted might be a hidden witch and so the protective medicine might, in fact, capture the spirit of the seeker after protection.

Consequently, ‘the most sought after doctors are foreigners. One goes to them, or has them brought at great expense’ 44 precisely because they would not involve the risk of local healers who might capture and use one's spirit.
Manipulation of medicines enabled suitably skilled men to control the lesser creatures. A healer who had such medicines could control animals beneficially; the most important of such were crocodile doctors who could protect cattle from attack whilst fording a river. 46 A witch, whose motives were evil, would direct his familiars to evil actions. 47 Snake doctors and those with lion magic were especially feared.
However, to beat the witches at their own game was too risky a course for commoners. So before one was bewitched it was generally better to employ a specialist healer with his protective medicines and when it was too late, to consult divination. Techniques of divination have changed more easily than other areas of ritual. For the 1880s and 1890s we can establish the range shown in Table 7, which I divide by general area of application and increasing seriousness of subject.

Siyaya ( liyaya ), sisongo ( cisongo, kayongo ) and tundundu are all ailments caused by mahamba . The symptoms are headaches and swelling of parts of the body; sisongo affects the legs of the patient, siyaya and tundundu affect the chest or stomach. Divination shows the cause, and exorcism and skilled treatment by an ng'aka are required. These mahamba would appear to be true ancestral spirits for, according to informants, siyaya is known to have existed among the Lozi of Lewanika's reign in the early years of the century. Its acceptance by the luyana was such that Kuntz (1932.131) considered that it was a Lozi ailment. In Mankoya, on the other hand, Symon (1950, 72-73, 76-77) noted that liyaya appeared only to affect the immigrant Wiko ( lunda-luvale ) peoples of the district. He records that the exorcism is assisted, in cases of sisongo and liyaya , by medicine taken orally and by hot fomentations applied to the affected parts of the body. He does not, as does Kuntz, mention inhalations. Modern mahamba , such as, ‘ ndeke (aeroplane), which is derived by infection from areas where planes are frequently seen. This lihamba is said to cause weakness of the legs when walking (McCulloch, 1951.78), were also encountered during the investigation, and one of these, bindele , is fully discussed in Chapter VI.

Warnings that the witches are at work may also come from dreams. To dream of being persecuted by a cow, a wild animal, or a European, means that a witch is after you, and there is a little trick to find out if this is so: “It is said that the eyes of the witches look a bit different in colour, and that some can see from the back of their heels. Experts in detecting witches say that if you apply sand or some specially prepared black powder to the back of the heels of such persons, if they really are witches, their eyes will at once begin to glow”...

I saw the patient once more about a week later. (It was a very long walk to the “village”.) The patient was unchanged. An incident had, however, occurred which convinced everyone that the patient's mother was a witch. A bird—probably a night-jar—had flown into the room in which she and some other women were sleeping. It blundered against the lighted lantern several times before it made off. The other women were terrified. The bird could only have been another witch turned into a hawk and come to call its fellow-witch to the night's assembly. The practitioner then insisted on shaving the mother's head and performing [Page 366] the rest of a witch's purification ritual. He insisted that she should confess—which she reluctantly and resentfully did. I then left the district and only later heard the sequel. The mother became more and more irritated by the medicine-man's nagging till one day she seized a stick and beat the patient. The medicine-man then said he would have no murderous assaults in his village so he expelled both the patient and his mother. Some labourers carried the patient in a litter to the main road where he and his mother were put on a lorry and not heard of again.

--p
When an Ashanti falls ill, and the sickness does not yield to the ordinary household remedies (really household magic), or cannot be diagnosed, it then becomes necessary to call in a doctor. The doctor, as we have already seen, may be either what we should call a general practitioner, or a specialist. The Ashanti word for the former is Sumanni (pl. Sumankwafo), or sometimes Oduruyefo, and for the latter Bonsam 'Komfo. The exact derivation of these terms is interesting. Sumanni is just one who deals in suman, i. e. charms. If we studied his methods superficially, we should say he was a herbalist, and so he is, in so far as he works with leaves and roots and plants; but there is this great difference—his medicines are not efficacious because of their antitoxic properties, but because of their magic properties. The disease, for which he sets out to prescribe, is itself caused by superhuman agencies, and can only be cured by similar counter-measures. [Page 148] It is spirit acting upon spirit, not antitoxin upon toxin. There are many allied diseases in the spiritual pharmacopoeia, with all of which the sumankwafo are capable of dealing. There is one, however, which he cannot treat, the most dreaded scourge in Africa, a malady which I suppose it is no exaggeration to state has taken toll of tens of thousands of lives—i.e. witchcraft. Against this disease the Ashanti calls in the specialist, the Bonsam 'Komfo. Now okomfo is really a priest, one upon whom akom (possession) may come, and Bonsam is a male witch. I have already dealt with the craft of witch-doctors, or white witches, or whatever we may decide to call them, and we have seen how an analysis of their title explains the source of their inspirations, for these are men who have learned to use and control black magic in order to defeat black magic.
As a general rule their methods of treatment are indirect, for they strive to cure the patient by stamping out the cause of the disease at its source, i. e. the discovery and exposure and killing of the witch. This quest, as we shall see presently, does not end with the death of the doctors' patient, for this ‘priest of the powers of evil’ will even call the spirit of the dead man, whom he has been unable to cure, to help him in his search for the murderer.

Besides these human-borne threats, the Dogon know their illnesses and environmental risks; however, these are not personalized. The treatment of illnesses is clearly differentiated from the protection against evil. Illnesses can be treated—evil cannot. The specialist in illness treatment, jòjòngunu, usually is not considered a dudugonu [sorcerer], though some suspicions may surface. General risks, such as drought, plague, or war, are not considered an evil from outside but are things with which the capricious supernatural world plagues its underlings.

Despite these obvious differences, some resemblances between the two societies' “rites of Monday” can be discerned. The individual is portrayed as a vulnerable being who is an obvious prey for the (supernatural) predators at large in the more or less direct environment. Still, that same individual has his or her defenses and can rely on outsiders; many of these private rituals do involve asking for professional assistance, an aspect notably absent in the great community rituals. In our examples, a diviner/blacksmith (Kapsiki) and a general ritual specialist (Dogon) are consulted. Individual rites also often call for divination, a professional service only a few qualified people can offer (Plate 11-8). The rites performed may be simple, but often are not, and in any case their application calls for specialized and secret knowledge. Even if the rites are simple, it may be much safer to have a specialist perform them.

Thus, the moves to establish oneself as an individual and the processes involved in maintaining the boundary between ego and community reinforce the social ties of the individual, making him or her more dependent on others. These social relationships are not to the same persons the individual seeks protection for or against (kith and kin or outsiders); on the other hand, the specialists are the same that may help threaten the individual supernaturally. A specialist in protection is also a specialist in aggression. To guard oneself, one must deliver part of the independence to those people who may be most dangerous to one's very existence.

Indeed, if divination is practiced by a skilled professional whose services are remunerated, every individual may on his own account interpret the “wondrous speech” (s`[unavailable]: tà:nie) of nature. The symbolic messages of “speech of the world” are not only valid for a static interpretation of universal categories, but they also assume a dynamic importance by standing as individual warnings that have a general bearing on the immediate future. The elements of interpretation are not the same in both cases because symbolic correspondences and mythological considerations of the species also come into play. For omens it is the particular event that is significant. For example, because the turtledove likes the perch on the Acacia albida tree and sings a song reminiscent of “sígi language” it is symbolically associated with the Fox and with death; but the song of a single turtledove in the bush would mean “return to the village, [Page 526] strangers have come” or “proceed calmly with your work,” according to the bird's position, whether between the person and the village or in the other direction toward the bush.

Being sensitive to music, however, does not necessarily mean that one is able to produce it himself. Ambara is in fact a very typical example. A supreme expert in all rhythms and a remarkable dancer who is able to cite the lyrics to almost any song, he is not capable of singing in his own right and is a mediocre drummer. It is not, he explains, that he has no oil [musical ability]. On the contrary, he has a great deal, but it does not come out and water comes in its place, that is to say, his song is mere “speech.” The oil comes as far as his throat and drops down, pushed by the uvula which, according to Ambara, “decides that person's work is not to sing, that he has other things to do.” This means that he should not engage in singing or playing an instrument if he has no talent.

Dyeing. — The wives of shoemakers are skillful dyers and are specialists in dyeing with indigo. The technique employed is as follows:
One hollows out of the ground a pit with a capacity of about one cubic meter, which one then varnishes with water in which yullo bark has been macerated. It is filled with water that has been made alkaline by adding vegetable ashes; a cake of indigo is thrown in and allowed to dissolve for three days. The dye is ready.
The material to be dyed is put to soak for two or three days; after drying, one may begin the procedure again. The cotton fabrics intended for feminine clothing may be decorated with white motifs on a blue background, which is obtained by protecting certain parts of the fabric, folded and held by ties, from the dye.
The wives of shoemakers dye, often to order, hanks of thread, strips of cloth, or ready-make clothing. They also buy thread or fabric at the market and, once dyed, resell it.
Except for indigo, dyeing is not the work of specialized craftsmen. The ritual objects (masks, fibers, etc.) are made and dyed by the persons concerned. The common colors are: white, obtained with calcined ashes; red, prepared from the plant andyu banu (red sorrel, Hibiscus); yellow, which comes from a Leguminosae, the gerele ( Indigofera macrocalyx); black, made with the fruits of the bala ( Acacia scorpiaides, var. pubuscens). Apart from the dyeing procedures, decoration is done with yellow or red earths (ocher); black motifs on wood are obtained by branding.

Even in cases where the sufferer’s own misdemeanour is responsible for the illness it usually takes a cult specialist to analyse the details and call attention to the probable circumstances in which the insult occurred. The diagnostic technique used is first to consider the nature of the illness and match it with those associated with specific spirits. Once the probable identity of the afflicting spirit is known the diagnosis proceeds to an examination of the circumstances in which the spirit could have been angered. With the diagnosis complete a boka (native doctor) who usually also has a cult status will first prescribe the sacrifice of an animal identified with the spirit. If this does not result in an elimination of the symptoms a curing rite (initiation) at the hands of the bori cult may be prescribed. During initiation the patient is treated with medicines symbolically identified with the spirit or spirits believed to have caused the illness. For example, if the illness has been caused by Danko (a snake spirit) the treatment will include the drinking of an infusion made from kanya (African ebony; Diospyros mespiliformis ) wood and kanwa (potash), the former being sacred to Danko.
As mentioned above, once a person has been marked by the spirits as a desired ‘mount’ he is initiated into the cult under the direction of the formerly afflicted. His initiation or ‘cure’ marks a transition from one achieved status to another; he becomes a minor ‘doctor’ and is qualified to treat others with similar afflictions. It is through affliction therefore that a person may earn cult status and gradually achieve religious acclaim even if his status among the non-afflicted remains unchanged and low.

At the broadest level, horses of the gods recognize possession-trance which is either na gaskiya (lit. of truth; authentic) or na karya (lit. of lie; fraudulent). They do not doubt the sincerity of bori na karya which may occur within their ranks; it is usually classed as total ineptitude, a problem for the divine horseman but not the cult. This attitude is further expressed in what might be called the ‘cancellation rules’ for a possession-trance event. It is not possible for an event to be ‘broken’ with fraudulent trance even if it is a subject for discussion by the participants and generally detracts from the excitement of the performance. Within the class of bori na gaskiya performances by individuals, there are those which are less spectacular in the demonstration of possession-trance than others; these are commonly by the newly initiated. Since possession-trance behaviour is recognized as learned and constitutes a skill, the inexperienced are not expected to be as proficient as devotees with a long history of cult involvement. The single, most important characteristic which native critics use to distinguish ‘true’ possession-trance from false is body temperature. They state that a person in true dissociation state perspires heavily, and his body should be hot to the touch. Lee also notes that sweat is the most important symbol of dissociation in Bushman possession-trance (1968: 44). For them perspiration is the visible expression of powerful medicines on the surface of the body, for the Hausa it is the visible expression of a spirit’s presence ‘on the neck’ of a devotee.

Chronic illnesses require a more drastic course of treatment than a single remedy or sacrifice and a diagnostician customarily prescribes an elaborate curing ritual which, as already indicated, is actually an initiation ritual. Whereas such rituals organized by a senior cult-adept emphasize the attainment of a new status, those organized by a musician focus only on curing the sufferer. Consistent with a musician’s avoidance of any demonstration of possession-trance, such skills are not encouraged in the neophyte. Musician-diagnosticians operate on the assumption that to invoke the afflicting spirits (at which they are particularly proficient) and beg their assistance in making the sufferer well-offering in exchange recognition of their power and a promise to provide them with regular sacrifices-is sufficient to achieve a ‘cure’. In such cases it is thought the spirits will remain dormant on the heads of the neophytes and thus no active trancing will be necessary. Such cures-the only ones musician-diagnosticians are able to provide-are regarded as incomplete or worse by practising cult-adepts, but because the sufferer and his relatives believe they can ‘work’ they are a popular alternative to total cult involvement.

Among the Kanuri as with many other Muslim peoples, there is a strong belief in the efficacy of the written word of the Quran. Quranic verses are bound in decorative leather cases and worn on a necklace as a protective charm (LAYA). Sickness and death are believed to be the result of someone's or some spirit's (JINN) evil intentions. One cure, called ALO, involves the MALAM writing a Quranic verse on a wooden board, washing the ink off into a vessel and then having the patient drink it. Besides the MALAM, there are secular specialists who deal with physical ailments such as muscular pains, swellings and broken bones. Kanuri also will seek the advice and treatment of Western- trained doctors.

Ed.: “Although the prevailing conception of the akombo is that of evil forces, each liable to cause some specific form of ailment or misfortune, it must not be thought that all ills which come upon mankind are believed to be due to supernatural causes. The Tiv recognize three possibilities or stages in every adverse event. The first thing is that the thing may have happened in a quite natural way. If a man meets with an accident, of falls sick of some common disease of which the symptoms are obvious, he does not necessarily at first suspect supernatural interference, and treats his wound or ailment without recourse to magic of any kind. But just as it is natural for animals to be healthy and for trees to bear fruit, so it is natural for the sickness to run its course and the sore to heal up. If it does not do so, then it is time to suspect other agencies at work, and recourse is had to divination to discover which particular akombo is interfering with the normal course of nature. If the symptoms are obvious it is not always necessary, of course, to go to the diviner. If you have a cough, or pains in the stomach, which do not yield to normal treatment, any knowledgeable elder can tell you from the symptoms of the complaint which akombo is the cause. You then go to some one who is master of that particular akombo, who gives you the medicine which belongs to it, and for this you pay a nominal fee ( t[unknown]ndo ataa ). You do not need to go through the full ceremony of ‘setting it right’ (magically), unless the medicine play an equal part. Finally, if all rites have been performed and there is still no sign of improvement, the cause must 183 be witchcraft. The guilty party is discovered by divination, and steps are taken against him as described below (p. 326). If action is not taken then, the man may die, but he cannot be killed by the akombo alone.”

“In its present form--but it changes continually as it spreads--the movement comprises two grades of initiate, which may be described as “practitioner” and “disciple”. The former has paid a high price for the secrets of the cult and the right to initiate others; the latter has purchased for a small fee (but this has lately risen from 4d to 6d in certain areas) immunity [Page -181-] from witchcraft, the ability to discern witches and freedom from all rules other than those prescribed by the practitioner.
“Initiation of disciples is commonly as follows: Arrive with fee, chicken and eggs, and a miniature leather-covered wand and whisk: deposit these with acolytes, one of whom takes charge of the chickens. The latter are killed and cooked in bulk; in the evening the candidates line up and the meat is divided among them. Thereafter some go to sleep in neighbouring compounds while others learn the Nyambuan song, the burden of which is ‘Down with Jebu ’ ( Jebu , from ‘counterfeit’, is the Nyambuan jargon for witch or witchcraft). Next morning candidates bathe ceremonially at a neighbouring pool and are then initiated with a ritual analogous to confirmation or baptism, the climax of which consisted of the drinking of a special potion. The whisks and wands are blessed and returned to them and they are told that the former will enable them to smell out any witches that come near them and to follow their trail, despite changes of shape. An estatic running round a course marked out with carved posts or trees follows, and initiation is complete. All other charms and medicines are surrendered and renounced before the ceremony begins.
“The practitioner also provides special medicines for all bodily and spiritual ills and sometimes practices divination and simple ‘magic’ for the entertainment of his clients. Most of the potions appear to be relatively harmless to normal persons, the main ingredients being red pepper, sorrel and various bitter [Page -182-] barks and roots; some deaths have been ascribed to drinking Nyambuan, however, and several cases of mental breakdown. The exact connexion is extremely difficult to prove in a court of law, and up to date no conviction has been obtained on charges of poisoning or possessing dangerous drugs.

The leopard’s whiskers are used in certain magical ways for the ceremonial casting of spells. If a leopard is killed it must not be touched until a practitioner of the supreme ‘akombo i biam’ has removed the whiskers; this practitioner also cuts up the body and he himself, or with the elders, eats the heart. The slayer also must go through certain rites of purification. The whole of the Tiv tribe chip the teeth in imitation of the leopard.

Tsav is a Tiv word, whose meanings can range from, at widest, knowledge or wisdom, to witchcraft and the witchcraft substance, supposedly found in the chest. It is possible that tsav has undergone a gradual narrowing down in meaning: at any rate, if you ask a Tiv, “Do you know tsav? ” the anwer will be an emphatic denial, since the primary reference is to witchcraft, although in discussing the meaning of the word, the sense of ability or talent will be recognized. When one asks about “good tsav, ” one may be told that all tsav is bad; alternatively, the ability to know mystically about people who are using witchcraft may be described as good tsav . “Tiv specialists” of the colonial administration seem to have regarded tsav as a morally neutral mystical power attributed to the elders and providing them with authority in the eyes of the people, akin in its nature to the mana reported from peoples of the Pacific. My own interpretation would be that tsav always has a vaguely sinister set of connotations, even though the Tiv distinguish between the group use of tsav by senior men in a way which is to some degree regulated and its reckless use by individuals motivated by mere envy; it is true that tsav has political aspects, but this serves more to indicate Tiv suspiciousness towards all forms of power than to prove the innocence of tsav . 27
Tiv tend to state that either there is no good tsav, or else that the capacity to see other people’s tsav is good tsav . In particular situations, however, the use of tsav may be approved or held permissible.

In practice, Tiv bother more about misfortune caused to important men by the envy of their relatives, than good fortune coming to them from the moral backing of their relatives; thus, I heard this comment on the illness of a prominent magicomedical practitioner, who had just received the promise of a primary school for his compound: “His agnates are saying that he has too much, he has a market, a dispensary, and now he has a school.” However, the occurrence of good fortune is felt to need some form of explanation, and this is found in the belief in the [Page 96] journey of certain elders to Mount Swem.

Another specialist with the supernatural, known as pangsa , lives in the second ku . She is a blind middle-aged woman who chants a meaningless set of syllables that superficially resembles a Buddhist sutra. She emphasizes the tempo of the chant on a drum. She attempts to ward off lust and disease. She is not considered as skilled as the pangsa living in other villages.
Though many men in the village were sceptical of the reputed abilities of the chom-jengi , saju-jengi , and pangsa , they tolerated members of their own families who consulted them. One male informant referred to shamanism as superstitious nonsense, and objected particularly to the dancing and the use of the drum. He pointed out, that it was considered illegal behavior by governmental authorities and that the Japanese tried to discourage it. He believed that a Buddhist priest is more capable of placating an angry or evil spirit. He estimated that twenty per cent of illness in the village was due to evil spirits. Others occurred because of physiological difficulties.

Blind male pongsa , derived from poksa (diviner), constitute a widely known occupational group already known during the Koryo dynasty (935-1392 A.D.). The Koryo period with its predilection for fortune tellers is well known to Korean scholars and classic geomancers. Pongsa would also pray for rain, or could bring about a curse. They were thought potent because Koreans often believe that the blind have another kind of sight, “eye sight of mind.” They frequently shave their heads like Buddhist priests and recite meaningless sutra-like passages. It is likely that these blind specialists have been influenced by the Tantric sect of Buddhism.

Among those individuals who deal with religious and ethical matters, the skilled pungsu or chigwon is accorded the most prestige. The pungsu , invariably a man, receives [Page 150] the social recognition extended to a distinguished scholar. He is believed to have profound insight into the universal bi-polarity of nature, i.e., Yin and Yang . Though he is considered an authority on Confucianism, his particular area of specialization is the interpretation of the cosmological text previously mentioned as Choo Yok (Book of Changes). 18 Even the lowly fortune tellers, to enhance their predictions, pretend to have rudimentary knowledge of the same text. The last professional pungsu visited Sam Jong Dong in April of this same year to do “field work” and to see a friend. The friend, a long-time resident of the village, often is consulted as a pungsu by those who cannot afford the services of a professional from elsewhere. A pungsu is well-informed concerning classical geography. He is said to understand pang or air (wind) and su or water (streams and springs). He is [Page 151] considered to be the authority who can best determine grave sites and building locations, also the best day for marriage. According to complex Chinese metaphysics, he assigns a positive or negative value to every feature of the universe, e.g., a mountain ridge is positive and a river negative. Geomancy is done with human anatomical terms. Since a suitable grave site for a deceased is thought to permit the living members of the family to prosper, the advice of the pungsu receives serious attention. He often uses a compass with Chinese characters designating the directions which are associated with the five basic elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water). Even for burials in the common village cemetery, the pungsu's advice is sought for the proper orientation of the body. 19 Since all things are reducible to the five elements, the birthday of the deceased is related to a direction for the determination of a suitable corpse orientation. Only thirty per cent of the villagers can afford a professional pungsu . Usually the villager who is a friend and lay associate of a professional is the amateur pungsu consulted. If eldest son suffers from misfortune, it is often believed that this is due to the poor location of his father's grave. In such an instance, another pungsu is called in who may recommend that the body be exhumed, examined and transferred to a new grave.

Traditionally, the cause of illness was often thought to be evil forces. Modern scientific theories of pathogenesis appear not to have been readily accepted by the aged. According to one informant who observed the circumstances he describes, until the early 1960s some elderly people who had suffered misfortunes such as illness among their children prayed and made offerings to supernatural beings. The same informant, who had served as an intelligence officer on a farm, was once told that a sterile woman had secretly gone into the mountains and prayed to the “mountain god” for a child. Under Communist rule such magico-religious practices of medicine [Page 111] now appear to have been almost wiped out. The presence of specialists in modern medicine on each farm has brought to everyone modern medical knowledge, which, together with the activities of the campaign against supernaturalism, has seriously weakened if not entirely obliterated the traditional beliefs. [*AL note: This was preceded by a section about an anti-religious campaign led by younger generations to obliterate old professions of traditional religious practitioners, including among their families. Appears to result from anti-religious sentiment due to communism.]

Shamans of various kinds are still consulted for illnesses although villagers believe the frequency is declining. Three different men, all from nearby villages, are called in periodically. However, trips are also made to the consulting rooms of two others, a ching tsao hsien [Page 389] (master of green grass) in Hsin Tien and a mi fang hsien (master of secret remedies) in Taipei. Shamans usually appear to be consulted with reference to illnesses which are psychosomatic in nature or those which are relatively hopeless, i.e., medical advice has not worked. This latter may be merely because sufficient time for medical treatment to take effect has not elapsed. If someone is sick, many kinds of practitioners may be consulted quickly, both medical and religious. Serious illness in children, male and female alike, stimulates the call for a shaman quicker than would identical symptoms in adults. Shamans are rarely used for old people (beyond age 60) who have not been vigorous recently because after 60, death is considered inevitable and any years granted beyond 60 were only due to the favor of the gods. With a terminal illness, the family patiently waits for death without treatment...
Two part-time hung tou (red-headed Taoist priests) from Hsin Tien participate at many big ceremonies in the village and li . Finally, one particular part-time shaman, a fa shih and his assistant from over the mountain were frequently hired for certain ceremonies. Perhaps the term hired is too strong for no fee was ever discussed when an invitation was extended but the fa shih always received a sizable gift for officiating, the equivalent of a week's pay for an experienced farm laborer, plus elaborate food. This man has the ability to inspire others to go into trances and then he can interpret what they say if they “speak in tongues” or read the “spirit characters” a man in a trance may write in sand which is spread in a fine layer on a table.

The belief that a fright does damage to the soul is widespread. If small children and infants are observed to be crying far more than is usual, it is assumed that they have suffered a fright and they can be relieved of it only by ceremonial means. One such ceremony, used after other means to pacify the child have failed, consists of covering a bowl of rice with one of the child's garments and rubbing the covered [Page 105] bowl over the child's hands and feet. Then, the person conducting the ceremony (who can be anyone with expertise -- when I observed it, the child's grandmother and one of her friends performed the ceremony) fills his mouth with wine and sprays it over the child's extremities and stomach. Paper money to the gods is burned as the conclusion to the ceremony. Ideally, this should be done immediately after the child has been “frightened,” but it is difficult to tell whether it is necessary until a few days have passed.

In religious thought the relation of the gods to the natural world they inhabit and control is equated with political and judicial life. Heaven and earth in this sense are known as hu , “courts,” or “prefectures.” The sun, moon, five planets, and five dippers are the positions (not necessarily identified with observable heavenly bodies) of the hu of heaven. They have earthly counterparts, such as the five sacred mountains. Knowledge of their names is left to the experts, diviners and priests, who act as lawyers and bureaucrats issuing petitions and passes and advising and guiding the client through the sacred protocol and squeeze.

Nowadays when illness strikes, the villagers observe its symptoms and try to determine its nature. From experience with certain basic sets of symptoms, illnesses are distinguished as being either in the realm of the physiological or supernatural, and therefore requiring a cure within that particular realm. Thanks to the villagers' new awareness of the germ theory of disease, most illnesses are immediately classified as physiological and, therefore, within the domain of science and medicine -- primarily modern, Western-style medicine rather than Chinese herbal medicine. Such illnesses as measles, rashes and skin diseases, trachoma, colds, stomach disorders supposedly resulting from bad food or water, and the like, all fall clearly into this category. To treat these illnesses, it is now customary for the villagers either to call in a Western-style practitioner or to choose their own drugs or patent medicines.

It is a commonplace among villagers that “No medicine can help if a person runs into something evil,” for example, one of the demons known as kuei or mo shen . Consequently, when the practitioner of Western medicine is unsuccessful in curing an ailment, the illness is [Page 258] clearly of supernatural origin and must be attacked by someone versed in supernatural methods -- the shaman.

There is no particular problem with illnesses which can be clearly diagnosed as natural or supernatural. But there are many cases in which the diagnosis is not so easy or clear-cut. Mainly, the villagers rely on past experience to tell them which set of symptoms indicates which category of illness, and thus which kind of practitioner to call in. Naturally, there are considerable variations among the villagers themselves which may predispose a decision in one direction or the other -- level of education, amount of experience, financial ability, and even types of social pressure. As one would expect, the actual availability of drugs and doctors affects choice. In recent years the dependence upon Western medicines and Western-oriented doctors has increased as a result of the increased supply of both at relatively low cost. The ease of access to antibiotics and patent medicines, their effectiveness, and the doctors' record of successes have given confidence in Western science, with the result that it is common today for the villagers to turn to Western methods first for most illnesses.
Many villagers now also feel that it is simpler to call in a Western-style doctor. A shaman often requires the assistance of two or three other people who must be asked in to help in the ritual, at their convenience. Further, when the Western doctor is called in, he charges a fee, and with its payment the transaction is completed. There is no residual feeling of obligation which must be discharged. The shaman, if he is a local one, usually charges nothing at all for his services, and often it is more comfortable not to incur such a feeling of obligation. Then, there are a number of incidental expenses connected with his visit -- the cost of sacrifices and the food for all the participants and observers at the ritual.
Having two types of medical practice at one's disposal is not always an unmixed blessing, however, since the decision that an illness is natural or supernatural may be, or may be held to be, influenced by external circumstances. A case in point is the following which happened to a very poor family in Hsin Hsing. The parents were no longer young and already had three daughters and a small son when another daughter was born. Before the infant was named (naming takes place on the ninth day and is, in effect, when an infant becomes human) she became quite ill. Instead of calling in a practitioner of Western medicine, which many villagers insisted they would have done first, the family chose to consider the illness supernatural because the baby was not yet nine-days-old. They called in one shaman, and then another. Despite their efforts, the infant died. Under the traditional ideas the death was attributable to the will of the gods, and the family had done all it could do. The villagers gossiped busily about [Page 259] the event, however, noting that the family was poor and had too many girls already; implicit in their gossip was a recognition that the family may have preferred to have the female infant die.

(Time and site, social and financial problems). The choices of a good time and a good site for building a factory or storeroom or for digging a well are seen by local people as crucial in preventing disease and the other misfortunes that would result from the offense, fright, or disturbance of geomantic forces, or of harmony ensuing from a bad choice. Patients also present social or mental problems: quarrelling, alcoholism, insomnia, anxiety, disobedient wives or children, a spate of traffic accidents, or flunked examinations. The diagnoses can often be linked to fate, offense, or the actions of ghosts. Lastly, people come in with a host of completely non-medical problems involving business, inheritance, or planning for the future. As there are no secular practitioners to help people sort out these problems, they come to Ong-ia-kong .
Prominent in any of Ong-ia-kong's treatments is the hû-á , a magic character which appears in many variants throughout the spread and history of Chinese religion. In this cult, the efficacious hû-á is scribbled with a brush by the tang-ki while in trance. A neater version is also written by the assistant with a felt-tip pen on the back of some of the papers given to the patient. The scribbled hû-á may be pasted on the wall, worn, or put inside or placed upon a car or motorcycle. It may be burned and added to an herbal brew for drinking or external application. It may be burned with incense and spirit money to propitiate an offended supernatural. There is almost no treatment that doesn't involve at least one hû-á . Most of the cases that have anything to do with health also include a list of herbs for brewing and drinking. Herbs, hû-á, and dietary proscriptions are most common for “disease caused from body.”
Treatments for ailments with supernatural causes generally include one or more of the following procedures:
(1) Instructions on propitiating the malevolent deity in cases of chhiong-hoan .
(2) Exorcism of an area -- a room, a place outside the house, the child's blankets.
(3) Referral to the market town temple for a regular ceremony performed there by Taoist priests -- these include star ritual ( chè-chhi n* ), patching of fate ( pó . - un * ), and crossing a gate.
(4) Recommending a relationship which resembles godparenthood without, of course, the Christian implications. When a human godparent is chosen, this relationship is called “dry, mother” and “dry child.” When a god is chosen, the child becomes a “contract child” ( khè-kiá n* ) or “contract grandchild” ( khè-sun * ) of the god.
(5) Recommending the making of a “soul basket” to cover the soul of the child. This is called khàm-hûn * “cover soul.” The child's name and birth time are written on red paper which is wrapped around some scraps of his hair and fingernails. This package is placed inside a small basket, covered with a cup, and hung from the beam of the family's ancestor hall. The ones I saw were made because of fright or “hard to raise” and were sometimes made in connection with the child's becoming a godchild...
In this section we return to the comments made in the introduction that (1) Ong-ia-kong is concerned with a different area of medicine than is Western medicine, and (2) the kind of treatment offered is very different. In reference to the first, three related conceptual matters must be taken up: (a) The perceived difference between Chinese and Western medicine; (b) the concept of patching; and (c) the concept of harmony ( pêng-an * ).
(a) In a survey of 300 households, I asked the question, “How would you compare Chinese and Western medicine?” This is a sample of the responses received:
Chinese medicine is slow, Western medicine is fast .
Western medicine hurts the stomach; Chinese medicine is gentle .
Whichever works is better .
Each has its advantages and disadvantages .
Chinese medicine is better for women's troubles and broken bones; Western medicine is better for acute disease .
All these responses I heard many times. But by far the most common was: CHINESE MEDICINE CURES THE CAUSE; WESTERN MEDICINE [Page 129] CURES THE SYMPTOMS. * To “cure the symptoms” means to relieve symptomatic distress. To “cure the cause” means to treat the causative agent and also to remedy the situation that allowed disease to develop or infiltrate. To discuss “curing the cause,” one must discuss “patching” and harmony.

The initial symptoms are usually taken to a Western-style doctor . If the Western medical treatment is sufficient, the patient is satisfied. But in the course of a disease or several disease episodes, the patient may feel the Western medicine is insufficient and go to other methods of treatment, perhaps including a visit to Ong-ia-kong . The following examples illustrate this point:
One child had frequent colds, fevers, and swollen glands. He was taken for treatment to a Western doctor; but, as the illness kept recurring, both the problem of patching and the problem of harmony became relevant. The mother patched the child's health with ginseng cooked with pigeon. And she heard from a fortune teller that his problems were caused by his father's brother, who had died without issue and wanted this child as his son. The dead man could only get this message across by disturbing the harmony of the family -- then they would seek out a practitioner who would make contact with the other world. A contract was drawn up for the child's adoption. * The child's health improved.

Time and place have special significance. Getting married on the wrong day or building a grave in the wrong place may have dire consequences. The almanac, which is found in almost every house, provides a general guide for choosing days, but is usually interpreted by a specialist. In addition, fortune tellers, priests, and gods (who communicate through divination or possession) may be consulted. Sites are more often chosen with the help of geomancers or older people who have mastered the important variables. But occasionally a time and often a place are selected without prior consultation. Row houses, for instance, are now located with regard to the street and neighbors. Thus when illness or misfortune occurs, the blame is often placed on incorrect choice of time or place. A place error usually can be corrected by relocation.

The second special ritual, Ch'i-sha , is to “lift” or drive away the bad atmosphere caused by malevolent deities. There is no piece of earth without its spirits (T'u-sha). Therefore any disturbance of the earth may [Page 100] disturb them and they in turn may cause illness, bad luck, or any of the other imaginable evils. Illness in young children is often ascribed to these spirits, as young children are particularly susceptible to malign influences. Construction, digging, repair, and burning are all possible sources of the relevant disturbance; when a child falls ill, it is often easy to find some such activity in the vicinity of the child's house. This ritual can be done after illness occurs, or ahead of time, when there is some earth disturbance. It may have to be carried out at the place where the earth was disturbed, but the professional practitioner can provide the diagnosis of the trouble -- cause of illness, location of disturbance, type of disturbance -- and the paraphernalia and directions for driving away the bad atmosphere. Usually ritual and/or herbal care is given to the child as well.

When her mother-in-law died, she said, her family had been too poor to afford the expensive merit ritual, but they soon suspected trouble when her father's sister, married into a [Page 111] wealthy family, became ill. After asking a very powerful god, she found out that there was trouble in her natal family, so she told them she would pay for a kong-tik for her sister-in-law. The ceremonies were duly performed, and not long afterward Ong-iong's mother went to a khan-bong (soul calling) specialist to talk to her mother-in-law. The spirit was crying, she said, but told her visitor that she had been much more comfortable in the spirit world since the kong-tik had been performed for her. Consequently, Ong-iong's mother was sure the rituals were effective. This was, of course, an empirical observation, but of the sort given little credence by most Taiwanese. Many fellow villagers have gone to khan-bong specialists themselves, and probably most had heard the old lady's story. But it takes a certain kind of credulous person to accept such evidence, and Ong-iong's mother was just that: a true believer...
One person who justified her belief in terms of experience, but who still expressed belief in nearly all tenets of the folk religion, was Ong A-mui, a 64 year-old daughter-in-law of Ploughshare's only former landlord, and one of the few village women over 40 with any formal education or knowledge of the Mandarin Chinese language. Asked about appeals to gods, she cited an example from her own experience. Once when she was ill, she sought advice from a lay practitioner at the Pai-chi temple, who gave her a simple remedy to take three days running. She recovered, and this was evidence to her that appeals to gods can be effective. She added that gods are useful for purely diagnostic purposes -- by using divining blocks, one can tell if an illness is self-limiting or needs medical attention. She was sure that the principles of day selection worked for both wedding and funerals, and then volunteered that what is definitely true is that someone who mistakenly watches a funeral when prohibited from doing so because of disharmonious characters will suffer adverse affects. She would not necessarily believe this without personal experience, she said, but she had a sister-in-law who became violently ill upon watching a coffin carried out of a house, and had to be cured by priests summoned from San-hsia. Again she based her belief in personal experience.

Harrell, Stevan. 1979. “The Concept of Soul in Chinese Folk Religion.” Journal of Asian Studies Vol. 38 (no. 3): 519–28. 

--p
The concept of “soul” ( ling-hun ) 1 is central to the study of Chinese folk religion for at least three reasons. (By “folk religion” I mean the religious beliefs and practices of the peasantry and other non-elite classes in late traditional China and in modern Chinese society outside the People's Republic. This term specifically excludes the textual religions (the State Cult, Buddhism, and Taoism) and also the beliefs and practices of religious specialists.) 
First, the idea of ling-hun underlies most notions of supernatural beings. As Wolf and Jordan have demonstrated for Taiwan, and as evidence from other parts of China also suggests, the great majority of supernatural beings propitiated by believers in Chinese folk religion are thought to originate from the “souls” of dead people. 3 “Gods,” or shen , are the “souls” of especially powerful or meritorious people; 4 ancestors, or tsu-hsien , are “souls” of one's own agnatic forebears; and ghosts, or kuei , are “souls” of those who died violent deaths or who have no descendants to worship them as ancestors. Second, the loss of one's “soul” is an extremely common explanation for many kinds of diseases and aberrations, both mental and physical, that are analyzed and treated by Chinese “sacred medicine.” 5 Many cures concentrate on getting the “soul” back. 6 Third, trance -- a state common to folk practitioners in many parts of southern China -- is invariably explained in terms of “soul” travel or spirit possession.

Adults can also suffer from involuntary “soul” loss, but in their case it is much more serious. Many things may be responsible for adult “soul” loss: attack by any of [Page 525] several kinds of supernatural beings, particularly malevolent ones, such as vengeance-seeking ghosts; 32 sorcery, performed by an evil specialist in writing magic paper charms which work on the victim by contagious magic; taking fright; or possibly a combination of one of these and a person's particular susceptibility in a given year. But the symptoms always seem to be those of what we would call severe mental illness. The one serious case I knew of involved a fifteen-year-old girl who did not return home from work one night and behaved strangely the next day and for several months afterwards. She was likely, especially in the afternoons, to go into screaming fits, at first wailing coherent phrases, like a mourner at a funeral, then falling into coarse groans and grunts. She would not respond to any of her relatives or friends when they tried to consold her or calm her down, nor would she, when she was in this state of mind, accept anything to eat or drink. Everyone in the rural community where the girl lived agreed that her ling-hun was gone; in fact, this diagnosis was confirmed by a succession of experts called in to try to cure her. Diagnoses of the causes of her condition varied from sorcery to a haunted house to a jealous great-grandfather angered over his lack of patrilineal descendants, but all agreed that wherever the malevolence came from, her ling-hun had been taken away. The “soul” was called, offerings were made to possible “soul”-thieves, and a sequence of charm-writers was tried before the girl finally seemed to calm down and resume more or less normal behavior. Like the children who lose their “souls” temporarily, this adult was exhibiting strange behavior patterns which the villagers could not trace to any obvious physical or social stimulus; only the loss of ling-hun could explain the girl's affiction.

The above song contrasts the pig's usefulness and willingness to help out with other domestic animals' usefulness and willingness to help out. The pig is obviously deficient in both areas: his work is minor and self-gratifying, and his lackadaisical attitude about dying shows that he is not ardent in the service of his owner. Indeed, pigs are even seen as faintly malevolent. One family, for example, was told by a ritual expert that their present difficulties stemmed from the fact that a pigsty had once existed underneath their kitchen. Unless they unearthed all the stones that the pigs had lived on, their difficulties would continue.

Although only the tang-ki was able to give me such a detailed analysis, almost everyone knew something about correspondences between the body and its house and tree, most commonly those [Page 239] linking the roof to the head, a woman's flowers to her children, and the roots to the feet. There is some individual variation in how other parts of the body are said to correspond to parts of the tree or house. This leaves room for the person with a dirty well, say, to assume that the well stands for whichever internal organ is causing him discomfort. At the least it is clear that a great many villagers engage in speculation about the relation of the body to its tree and house; it is not an esoteric matter restricted to ritual experts.

Shamans hone their skills through their helper spirits in a mutual courtship more subtle than most of the ethnographic literature portrays. In Yurok (Native American) shamanic thinking, “The Hawk is not just a beautiful bird who has certain physical characteristics; it is a spiritual source of power. It can be used for seeing because it is a good seer; it can be used for protection [Page [p 312-a]] because it is a strong fighter; it can be used for soul travel because it can fly long distance against great odds and the forces of nature” (Medicine Grizzlybear Lake 1991:4). Sakha believers similarly describe a range of power properties for helper spirits, for example the all-seeing pivot eyes, high flying, and endurance of the eagle, and the acute senses, wisdom, targeted violence, size, and nurturance of the bear. Shamans expect to gain diverse helper spirits over their lifetimes as they build power and expertise...
The seance is more than a tidy liminal ritual system that returns community participants to some status quoante. Spirits, patients, and shamans are interwoven within a constantly adapting symbol system. For example, Konstantin oiuun sewed gifts that grateful patients had given him onto his shamanic cloak. Thus he added the spirit of their love to the bones and metal ornaments symbolizing his connections with helper spirits, including the raven and bear. An elderly Evenk female shaman has given at least one patient a small brass bell that she instructed the patient to ring in emergency, so that the shaman could fly through the tundra to the urban patient’s aid. The patient, touching the bell with awe, explained in 1994 that she has used this boon with success, but sparingly.

Their technological skills and knowledge enable the Garos to draw sustenance from the natural environment in which they live. They are also surrounded by a spiritual environment, and though the Garos are remarkably uncertain of its nature, they know that they must behave in appropriate ways toward it if disaster is not to overtake them. Other than me’mang (‘ghost’,) the Garos have only one general term, mite, for supernatural beings; but this covers both beings whom we would call gods and certain lesser, quite different nuisances, which hardly deserve to be known by any term more dignified than spirit. The latter, distinguished from the gods as “the mite that bite,” are numerous and ubiquitous, and when they bite they cause disease. Beyond this, little is concretely known about the mite, [Page 55] and the usual response to a request to describe them more fully is “We don’t know what they look like because we can’t see them. What do you think about them?” Garos were puzzled, for instance, by the question of whether the spirits were male or female. Such questions simply do not arise, and in the Garo language it is possible to talk about a spirit without being forced to choose a third person pronoun indicative of gender. There is no question but that they cause disease, however, and just enough is known of their habits, even if not of their appearance, to allow such action to be taken against them that they will be persuaded to stop biting and permit the sick person to recover. The symptoms of the disease indicate which spirit is causing it, thus allowing those concerned to choose the proper kind of sacrifice. Any Garo can name a few mite, along with the disease that each produces, the place where it lives—or at any rate the place in which the sacrifice to it should be performed—and the manner of the sacrifice. A few men who are more interested or skilled in these matters can give dozens of names. Susume mite, for instance, causes alternate chills and fever, a frequent complaint in this malarial country, and to drive it away an altar of bamboo and leaves must be built in the yard in front of the house. A pig or chicken is sacrificed at this altar, and the animal is eaten. When a spirit known as but causes an attack of dysentery, a small boat is built of bamboo, dabbed with the blood of a sacrificial animal, and floated down the river; and the spirit is supposed to follow it. Other mite are held responsible for paleness, lassitude, skin diseases, and all the other aches and pains which plague the Garos. Each can be pacified with a special form of sacrifice...

The supernatural world of the Garo consists of supernatural beings ( mite) and spirits of dead persons ( me’mang). 13 The Garo do not attribute any form to both of these two categories of beings. However, some supernatural beings are considered as males while others are females (however, in Garo language it is possible to speak about them without mentioning their sex). Both these two categories of supernatural beings act and [Page 66] behave like human beings. When offended they take revenge by causing harm to the offending human beings. The supernatural beings ( mite) cause illness, failure of crops, cause damage to houses by lightning and similar other calamities. The behaviour of supernatural beings can be made to comply with the wishes of human beings by performance of appropriate rites which consist mainly of sacrifices. The common term for illness is mite chika (biting by a spirit). Besides the sex attribute of a few supernatural beings nothing is known about them. The clan organization which pervades all aspects of the society of the living has no meaning in the supernatural world. Magico-religious rites among the Garo are not fraught with functions and such functions are not fraught with too many taboos. Professional shamans, or any other kind of professional intermediaries between human beings and supernaturals are absent among the Garo. Any person who is conversant with the technicalities of magico-religious rites can perform them. However, magico-religious rites performed for the well-being of the community in general are performed by the village priest ( kamal) who is supposed to be well acquainted with the procedure of such rites. There may be several such specialists in the village. Usually after the death of the seniormost the next senior man steps in. The office of the kamal is in no way hereditary. He does not enjoy any special privilege in the village community.

Practitioners. The two classes of religious practitioners are the village or state priests and the sacrificers. Both are male. They use the same divinatory techniques of reading broken eggshells and the entrails of cocks, and they both sacrifice cocks, hens, goats, pigs, and cattle. Their skills are not taught to them so much as picked up by observation and confirmed by demonstrations of efficacy. A priest is elected from among the men of his sib to direct his skills to the public good until he dies, and his rewards are institutionalized and come from the village or the state. A sacrificer acts for private persons or kin groups, on call, and is rewarded by them personally with gifts in cash or in kind. The sacrificer is called upon to explain and then to ritually remedy every variety of misfortune, especially illness, though his powers are nowadays regarded with ambivalence, and he is widely expected to become a sorcerer sooner or later. ... 
Illness and medicine. In time of illness, a Khasi calls in a sacrificer, and possibly also a medicine man. The medicine man is an ordinary individual who has hit upon some herbal remedy for one or more ailments, who has become famous enough to be sought out and rewarded in cash, and who jealously guards the formula of his medicine until it dies with him. He and his patients tend to regard him as specially blessed.

Among the Santals two kinds of ojhas can be seen: those who learn for pleasure’s sake and those who learn seriously and earnestly. In the case of the first no initiations are required after the learning is over, whereas in the second, initiation is the essential part of the learning. To become an ojha (both professional and amateur) one has to be a disciple under an expert ojha . The first course commences in the middle of Jaishtha (May and June), their first sitting being on a Sunday or in some cases on a Friday. Every day they come to the house of the guru after taking their meals. They take their seat in the courtyard of the guru’s house. In the [Page 124] courtyard there is an elevated place, square, or rectangular, the size generally being 1½’ X 1½’ X 1’. It is made of earth, and a Tulsi (Ocymum Sanctum L.) plant is planted in the centre of the mound over which a shed is erected. The shed is so large that it can easily accommodate 10 to 12 persons. The shed is erected by the unmarried disciples, married ones have nothing to do with the erection of the shed. The posts of this shed are of sal wood. In the centre of the shed a hen’s egg and a chir sakom (a thin kind of iron wristlet or arm ornament) are kept for preventing witches from molesting them. The course lasts for four months. A woman cannot be an ojha . The first act of the ojha is what is called Akhra rara which means performing the opening ceremony, to ensure that all may go well and without any hindrance. The first evening the disciples bring along with them some sindur which is given to the guru . In five different places in the courtyard the ojha makes vermilion marks in the name of the following five different bongas :—
(1) Kamru guru (the reputed first teacher of ojha science to the Santals),
(2) Sin Bonga (the sun),
(3) Kali mai (the goddess Durga), 1
[Erratum: this should read “(the goddess Kali).” Cf. errata sheet, p. x - Analyst]
(4) Dibi mai (the goddess Durga),
(5) Ganga mai (the Ganges goddess).

Magic and witch-craft are an essential part of the belief of most of the Hinduised tribes and the pre-Dravidian people resident in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Although it cannot be vouched for a certainty as to whether the Santals borrowed it wholesale from the Hindus, there is some internal [Page 309] evidence showing the influence of Hindu ideas on Santal magical practices. In the race of life, the Santal finds inexplicable super-normal phenomena. He does not know how to react to the unknown and unknowable; so he has recourse to magic to deal with the impersonal forces and energies through appropriate rites and spells. This is done not by all the Santals, but only by the Ojha, a specialist in the art of magic and witch-craft. And he is generally the common doctor for all the Hinduised tribes and the Mu[unknown]n[unknown]dà people. What the witchdoctor does is to practise the art of dissociating himself with the aim of spirit-communication, when he chants some magic formulae and makes the patent gestures while he performs the time-honoured rites to conjure the spirits. All these he does with the aid of some spirits, and although his mission is like the priest of religion to attain curative results that endure to the benefit of Santals individually or the tribe taken as a whole, it cannot be said that antisocial results do not follow due to the activities of some malignant Ojhas out to wreak personal vengeance on their enemies with the aid of malevolent spirits.

Two washermen [* AL: washermen are reference to a caste, lower than Goyigama but not the lowest] are involved in curing. One is an animal doctor. The other is an ‘evil eye’ specialist who can identify illness caused by ‘evil eye’ projection and who can prescribe countermeasures. A third washerman is training to be a kapuraala . (A kapuraala is a ritual specialist. Further details appear in Chapter V.) In Rangama the paramount kapuraala must always be a member of the Goyigama caste [* AL: highest caste; agriculturalists, about half the population, includes middle- to upper-class people], but assistants may be washermen.

At the time the writers was at her place, one pregnant girl went to ask for help in her delivery. The shaman gave her a bunch of bananas which were cast with mantra. The girl is supposed to eat the bananas to insure a safe and easy delivery. (Bananas are always used for such a purpose by various magical practitioners.)
Another woman asked the shaman for advice on whether she should buy a piece of land. The shaman then described the characteristics of the land and told the woman that it was not a good land topographically. The woman seemed to agree with her. Another woman asked her about the reason for her family's quarrels and unhappiness. The shaman suggested that she should make offerings to appease the house spirit, who was being angry with her ill-advised deeds. One young girl wanted to know whether her husband would leave his mistress and come back to her. In that case the shaman advised her to keep calm. It was the husband's nature to have a number of mistresses. If the wife could keep silent, the family would prosper, and so on.
The shaman certainly plays a useful role in the village. Those who have nowhere to turn can find a psychological refuge in her. Whether the possession is absolutely real is not particularly important. So far as she keeps her financial demand within a limit, bribery would be out of the question. The point is, she is able to give [Page 54] reasonable advice. Certain cures are psychological rather than physical, for a certain illness is sometimes psychological anyway. We must admit that she possesses more than the usual intelligence. With the quickness of wit she can handle various situations with ease. Her advice is valid in a sense that it is considered so by her patients.

The supernatural intrudes into village life in a great variety of ways. Events such as marriage and raising a new house are often timed to occur on auspicious days. Almost all stages of rice cultivation can be marked by some simple ritual designed to ensure success. Sickness may be explained and treated in terms of the actions of spirits, the withdrawal of the gods' protective influence, or loss of a spirit of the body. Further treatments include the use of magical herbal medicines and other techniques practised by ritual specialists. There is also a whole host of [Page 183] protective charms varying from privately recited formulas to tattoos and many types of amulet which make one invulnerable to bullets or knife wounds, or which ensure success in such ventures as winning the love of another.

It is evident that in Buddhism the Thai intellectual has a Weltanschauung which is both satisfactory and comfortable. This faith in traditional religion has saved him from heart-rending introspection and self-criticism and has preserved for him a matter-of-fact approach to life. The Thai intellectual is above all pragmatic rather than speculative ... Most educated Thai are officials faced daily with the stubborn facts of life. They are not therefore given to flights of imagination. They fit comfortably into an established structure of social organization. They are not stimulated by idleness and failure to an examination of the [Page 42] fundamentals of that structure or of the ultimate values upon which it is based. In a very real sense, the educated group is a class with a vested interest. Consequently it is conservative and pragmatic rather than radical and speculative.
The closest approximation to a psychological literature resulting from these fundamental intellectual orientations are religious and secular didactic essays, public school texts on morality, self-help or “peace of mind” tracts, and satirical or didactic fiction and poetry. (Mosel 1961 provides an excellent discussion of contemporary Thai poetry.)
1  Although this is not the place to go into a detailed discussion of Thai intellectual life and its effects on native psychological theory and the lack of an analytic literature, it might help to realize that Thai intellectual commentators are still principally a literati rather than an intelligentsia, in the sense that Redfield (1953: 42–44, and Redfield and Singer 1954), following Childe and Toynbee, explicitly used these terms; that is, they are (Redfield and Singer 1954) specialists who “reflect, synthesize and create out of the traditional material new arrangements and developments that are felt by the people to be outgrowths of the old. What is changed is a further statement of what was before... The ‘literati’ who fashion a Great Tradition do not repudiate the values and outlook of their rural hinterland but systematize and elaborate them under technical specialization.” An intelligentsia, on the other hand, is comprised of heretics, dissenters, and marginal men who challenge, interrupt, or destroy the ancient traditions to bring forth totally new intellectual orientations. They are the “cosmopolitan” individuals who historically tend to arise only after the native civilization has come into prolonged contact with or is stimulated by foreign cultures and ideas.
This distinction is not only taxonomically useful, but in Thailand's case seems to fit with actual historical circumstances ... Throughout these years, the intellectuals, as literati associated with the court (and often the court itself: some of Thailand's greatest poets and dramatists were kings) helped maintain, develop, and glorify this civilization, but not change it radically. ... In this type of [politically autonomous] intellectual environment, still oriented toward the synthesis and integration of the new into the old, it is not surprising to find a Western-trained Thai psychiatrist describe Sigmund Freud as a person “who did not have too much to say because he wrote only about sex.” Perhaps the most fitting characterization of the values underlying the purposes of the Thai intellectual is provided by the motto of The Siam Society, the one major association in Thailand approximating a society of scholars, which is “Knowledge Produces Friendship.”

The use of dangerously polluted material in love magic occurs when a man resorts to the strongest magical means known to ensure the love of a woman. It entails putting but a single drop of námman phraaj, the fluid which magical practitioners extract from certain corpses, 1 in the food of the woman. Upon swallowing the food, she will become totally enslaved to the man. This occurs only rarely, because námman phraaj is rare. Only a specialist with great magical powers will try to obtain the liquid from the corpse of a person who died inauspiciously, preferably from the most dangerous kind of corpse: that of a woman who died whilst pregnant or during childbirth. Reputedly, in the deep of the night the lay magical specialist approaches the place where such a corpse lies. He should grasp the dead body firmly in his arms, and extract some liquid from the skull by holding a lighted candle under the chin of the cadaver. A terrible struggle may ensue before the corpse releases some of this námman phraaj. The liquid is extremely dangerous, and in present times there are only a few men who are reputed to possess it. Only a desperate man will try to use it as love magic, for whilst it certainly causes a woman to be enslaved to a man, it may make her very ill at the same time. It is said that she may become mentally deranged for the rest of her life by consuming some of the liquid.

It is apparent to these young people that the paraphernalia used during ceremonies often serve a symbolic function. Betel leaves and areca nuts can be used in a ritual and then they seem to indicate the concepts of agreement, harmony and understanding. Gold-and-silver leaves are present whenever it is appropriate to include the ideas of prosperity and wealth. Rág-leaves appear when it is necessary to stress the concept of love. It is more difficult in many cases to decypher the messages of, for example, a tray with unhusked rice, puffed rice, green peas and sesame seed. Such knowledge is reserved for the ritual specialist who prescribes and prepared the ingredients during elaborate ceremonies. The young people may regard it as esoteric lore.

In former times, the timber for building a house could not be bought from another person, but had to be gathered in a forest by the man who built the home, accompanied and assisted by his intimate friends. They often took the ritual specialist along in order to decide which trees were auspicious. The specialist selected trees which grew in favourable positions, and made sure that the types of wood selected were considered auspicious in ritual lore. Wood considered auspicious was, for example, máaj [unknown] ( Shorea obtusa) and máaj [unknown] ( Pentacme siamensis). A good timber tree, but dangerous because of its reputed attraction to certain spirits was máaj takhian ( Serianthes grandiflora, Erythophloeum succirubrum). Most of the trees which were considered inauspicious were unsuitable for housebuilding; they rotted quickly, were easily devoured [Page 164] by insects, were too wet or too heavy. One tree, although useful as timber, was avoided because its name máaj [unknown] ( Afzelia xylocarpe), sounded inauspicious since the syllable khâa was associated with the Thai word for ‘to kill’, ‘to murder’. In modern times, timber factories sell this wood under a new name, máaj [unknown], a name suggesting an increase in happiness. The woodcutters took great care to let the trees fall in an auspicious direction, and the ritual specialist was at hand to interpret the creaking sounds in the wood just before falling. These sounds were seen as a communication from the spirit of the wood, the [unknown].

The ritual is officiated by a specialist called mo tham khwan nak ( mo means doctor). He recites, in a sonorous voice, the story of how man reaches maturity, all the parental hardships, in particular, those of the mother who went through pregnancy, the labour of childbirth, and child rearing. The nak [* AL: candidate monks, after their time abiding to 227 precepts ] who are dressed in a white robe bow low and listen meekly to the recitation about their growth due to their parents. There are some who shed tears from the overwhelming realization as never before of just how much their parents have done for them.
On finishing the recitation, the specialist who presides over the ritual opens a hole in a coconut for this purpose and feeds the nak three spoons of coconut milk each. The coconut milk symbolizes the essence of life or purity ( borisut).
To complete the ritual, a candle after being passed three times around the family and kin members seated in a circle is blown out in such a manner as to [Page 35] direct the smoke to the nak. This act signifies that he has been given a good infusion of soul in order to nourish his will. Most of those who attend this ritual present the nak's parents with an envelope containing a small amount of money as an act of mutual help and a means of merit-making as well.

The only way a girl could train herself for her task, if she wanted to become a priestess, was to accompany a priestess regularly whenever the latter went to do her work with sick people. This going into apprenticeship is called mobanda (what the apprentice gives to the priestess as recompense for the instruction is also called banda ). The apprentices sit close to their mistress and parrot the litanies that they hear her recite. The time that they need to master the litany varies greatly. It has happened that little girls had memorized several pieces from the litany as a hobby before they seriously became apprentices of a priestess, so that their learning time took only a few months. In some areas the pupils were given finely chopped Cordyline stalks to eat in order to make them proficient quickly. Cordyline, after all, is the plant that is used a great deal by the priestesses. Sometimes too the apprentices chew splinters of guideposts which indicate the direction in which pointed bamboos and spring-lances are set. It is claimed that apprentices who are able to knot together the needles of the sawadjane (a kind of needle-bearing tree) will quickly learn the art.

In the chapter on “The Life of the Soul,” we have seen how werewolves ( taoe mepongko ) eat up someone’s vital strength ( tanoana ) in the form of the liver. A masseuse ( topopagere ) is then called. She feels the sick person and then maintains that his liver has indeed disappeared from his body. It is said that the werewolf has stuffed tree leaves in the body in place of it. As proof, she brings these to light. She also tries to provide the patient with a new liver. For this she squeezes a chicken liver into little pieces with her fingernails above the pit of the sick person’s stomach and then blows on it. People believe that the chicken liver enters the body [Page 261] and replaces the lost liver. Those who are said to understand this method of curing well go to work in the following way: they take for this a large leaf from one tree or another and make a cut in it. They now put the leaf on the pit of the stomach and suppose that with this a cut has been made in the stomach. A chicken liver is now stuck into the leaf through the cut, after which the medical practitioner blows on it with all her strength. She knows how to spirit away the liver, and now it is said to have moved into the body of the sufferer.

As we have already seen, indispositions are generally ascribed to causes that come from outside. For this reason the treatment of a sick person is completely external; the idea of “taking in” medicines was originally strange for the Toradja. The medicine is applied externally to the sick parts. The way in which this is usually applied is to chew the medicine and then to spit it on the body, actually to puff ( mosoepa ). The medicine is then mixed with the saliva and the breath of the medical expert, which makes it even more beneficial.

The priestesses often apply this method, but the ordinary medical expert uses it, too. If, for instance, during a fever the entire body is swollen, the leaves of the banta tree are cut into pieces and mixed with water; with this water the swollen body is washed or wet; rope made from the Gnetum gnemon L. ( soeka ) is rubbed with the sap of the banta (the so-called oela banta ) to make it durable; people also want to achieve this effect on the patient’s body by means of the bath.

Knowledge of, and contact with, the gods and spirits is mainly confined to shamans, who are women or men choosing to dress and act like women. The ancestors are of concern to everyone. Shamans (TADU) are principally curers. They have guardian spirits whom they can send to the other worlds to retrieve people's souls and cure illness. Soul loss is believed to be a widespread cause of illness. There are also other religious practitioners with particular skills such as in curing smallpox or rainmaking. These are called SANDO, and can be either men or women. Divination and soothsayers (MONTOGOE) are important for understanding the will and guidance of gods and spirits. Another person with a religious function is the head-hunting leader or TADULAKO. In former times, witches and sorcerers were also significant figures in the society (Downs 1956: 37ff.).

Sorcery could be learned from others for payment (II, 176), but its power could also be acquired inadvertently by chewing lime in which the saliva of a sorcerer had fallen (III, 234). The method by which sorcery was learned was secret, but it was said that its practitioners had a special object, shaped like a cucumber, which was the source of their power. When its owner rubbed his or her hand over it it imparted something to it that made others who came into contact with it sick. The possesser of such an object was, moreover, forced to use it, as if he didn’t it would make him sick (II, 176).

Each of the seven supernatural beings we are discussing has the power to become incarnate as one particular bird. These incarnations never vary: thus. Membuas always takes the shape of a Banded Kingfisher. When any one of the seven birds is seen or heard by an Iban, this is believed to be a pronouncement by the gods, either commending, or cautioning against, a proposed course of action. Everything then depends on interpreting the prognostication aright, and assenting to it with zeal. Many details must be taken into account: the precise movements of the bird, the type of cry it uttered, and the exact time and place of the event. Each bird is regarded as having a special character of its own, and to be associated with varying kinds of activity. Furthermore when two birds of different species are encountered in close succession (as often happens), it is their joint meaning which must then be taken into reckoning. Because of all these variable factors, the whole system is exceedingly complex, and to become an expert augur a man must go through many years of diligent and patient apprenticeship.

Most adult Iban have some knowledge of divination and study the livers which are presented for examination. Real experts ( orang pandai ) are few; there is not always one in a longhouse. These offer their opinion only when specifically asked. Limbang, for example, explained once that, to judge by the liver he was shown, it was quite obvious to him that a sick Delok child would die, but since the others seemed satisfied with it, he said nothing. The child died.

Since the names of the ancestors of the first class, those who are termed “ancestors of the other side”, cannot be the same for all households, since, moreover, there are but a few priests, expert genealogists, it is necessary that those in whose behalf the sacrifice is offered inform the actual performer about the names of their ancestors or at least about the names of those who head the various lines of descent. Consequently all households must know their pedigrees, or if actually they don’t know, because they are rather young, they have to call one of their relatives who knows and who can inform the priest. Should they not do so, should they allow the priest to go on with the rites notwithstanding the fact that his initial invocation of ancestors was defective on account of lack of information, they would surely displease those among the ancestors they did not call, who afterwards, as they believe, may take their revenge by causing illness or death.

Until the second world war, when weavers began to earn larger sums of money for their weaving, the township was relatively self-sufficient. The land was more thoroughly cultivated, and the village boasted a number of local specialists. These specializations were linked with particular family lines. Certain families were blacksmiths; others were undertakers, joiners, cobblers, or midwives. As generations succeeded one another, occupations were not thrown open in the competitive, individualistic way of the mobile city. Certain occupations were seen to be “naturally” linked with particular families. Sometimes it was said that people of a particular family (which might include quite a number of collateral lines) had hereditary characteristics which suited them for particular occupations. ...
Whatever the rationalization, cobbler fathers begot cobbler sons. The present postmaster's grandfather was the first postmaster in Shawbost, and when help is needed in delivering the mail it is the postmaster's first cousins who are likely to help out. As late as the 1950's, the township still had its own undertaker, a man who had learned from his father the art of laying out and dressing the body but who didn't like the job very much and was happy enough to turn it over to an undertaker who traveled from Stornoway.
The island has had a veterinarian, based in Stornoway, for the past 30 years or so. Earlier, certain blacksmiths and farmers treated ailing livestock when the crofters needed them. For human ailments, there were many cures by plant and spell.

It is small wonder that the Lapps had a high opinion of the bear at a time when there were no firearms. The bear is bigger, stronger, and wiser than all the other animals; at the same time he is very swift and nimble. He can climb trees, and he can walk on two feet like a man. His habit of sleeping during the winter is so extraordinary that there seems to be something supernatural about it. And yet an expert Lapp bear hunter did not fear the strength and dexterity of the individual bear. When the bear was roused from its sleep and came out through the narrow opening of its den, drowsy and bewildered, the hunter had to direct his spear towards the breast of the beast and keep it steadily, pressing the shaft end to the ground and avoiding the grip of the approaching bear. This was a dangerous job, but if he should fail, there were companions present to come to his assistance. The real danger came from the invisible (magic) power which was inherent in every bear. We risk rationalizing the ideas of the ancient Lapps too much if we say that they thought that the bear had a genius or guardian spirit. They did not distinguish sharply between the individual and the species. No doubt in their incantations they invoked the species or the invisible power which was inherent in all the individuals, but they could not help addressing, after the successful hunting expedition, the very sample which they had just killed. When they wanted the bear to come back to be killed again (a wording which they carefully avoided), did they mean that the very same individual bear should return? I think it would be a psychological mistake to press this question.
Now let us return to the hunting ceremonial. We are told that the bear hunters went to the den in a solemn procession. First went the man who had “ringed in” the bear; he carried a staff with a brass ring at its end. (Brass was the sacral metal of the Lapps; almost all vessels and implements that had anything to do with the bear ritual should be made of brass, or at any rate they should be adorned with this metal.) Then came the sorcerer, and next came the man who was charged with the killing of the beast. There were also other distinguished functionaries, for instance the wood-carrier and the water-carrier necessary for the subsequent banquet...
Having killed the bear, the hunters (or one of them?) sang a song in which they thanked him for having been gentle enough not to damage their spears. (Maybe they had before the killing asked the bear not to bite or claw the hunter, as the ancient Finns did according to the forty-sixth song of Kalevala. ) Then they lashed the dead beast with twigs. The purpose of this obviously was to confer vital force upon the bear, to give him a kind of substitute or compensation for the life which he had been deprived of. The jocose habit of rousing the children in the morning of Easter Sunday by lashing them with a birch twig, which has survived up to these days in the Scandinavian countries even among the urban population, has the same magic background, namely the belief that the life-force which is inherent in budding twigs can be transferred to living beings. ...
The happy hunters also used to shake their spears at the dead bear and put their skis across it. By doing so they improved [Page 160] their chances to be successful on later hunting expeditions. The killer would also wind a birch twig around the lower jaw of the bear, attach his belt to this ring, and then repeatedly jerk the beast from its position, singing a cheerful song all the time. It may be that this action was an alternative to the lashing.
The hunters covered the bear with spruce twigs, and leaving it on the spot till the following day, they went home. When they came near to the dwelling place, they sang a song about their feat. The women answered by singing a song, praising the bold hunters.
According to some sources, the man who had killed the bear should keep in his hand a whip plaited of birch twigs and beat with it thrice on the back entrance of the tent or hut. There is some obscurity in the tradition concerning this detail. Probably we have here to deal with the same twigs already mentioned in connection with the killing of the bear, and these twigs seem to have played an important role in the whole bear ceremonial almost from the beginning. The plait was handed over to one of the women (the wife of the killer?) and wrapped up in a linen cloth. During the festival it was decorated with brass leaves and the like. After the banquet the vertebrae of the bear were threaded on the plait in their natural order and then buried together with the other bones of the beast.
The hunters were not allowed to sleep with their wives until three days after they had killed the bear; for the leader of the hunting the celibacy lasted five days. And then they had to undergo a special purifying ceremony. Each of them should run around the hearth, imitating a bear, and when he ran out of the tent, his wife threw hot ashes after him.
In some regions at least, the men and the women are the bear together, after the meat had been brought into the ten through the back entrance and cooked by one of the men, but there were several restrictions regarding the women. They were forbidden to eat certain parts of the bear, their portions had to be boiled in a separate kettle, and the pieces of boiled meat had to be handed over to them on wooden sticks. And according to a still more strict [Page 161] observance, the men raised a tent or hut for themselves, where they did all the cooking and spent all their time, day and night, as long as the festival lasted. Half-grown children were sent from the men's tent to bring the women their portions.

Aspen wood has sometimes been used for skis, which were light and hard (in the Skolt areas in Petsamo), and for pails and barrels; in Utsjoki alder has been used for bowls and cups, but otherwise only alder bark is used for tanning hides. In Inari aspen is hardly used at all, even for firewood, as it takes a long time to dry. Birdcherry wood can be used for hoops, hames, and pipe stems; willow and sallow for hoops; mountain ash for hoops, rakes, and handles. “A hoop made of mountain ash and a pole made of spruce lasts one's whole life.” Mountain-ash bark has sometimes been used for tanning. Juniper can be used for wooden nails, rakes, handles, pegs, and for small implements attached to fishing tackles.
Use of wood and opinions about the different qualities of wood vary according to locality. A Mountain Lapp naturally makes observations different from those of a forest dweller.
Wood for building purposes is felled when one comes across a suitable tree in the forest. If all of it cannot be taken along, the rest is left for another occasion. If a great quantity of wood is needed, it is transported in reindeer sleds. Carpenters keep wood stored at home. Some men are so interested in woodwork that they cannot make any conversation except about wood. An old man in Utsjoki called Tor'te-t[unknown] seähtsi (“Uncle Spinning Wheel”) had gathered so much wood in his home that he could hardly find room enough to sleep in. Boats and sleds require the longest time to prepare, but making a spinning wheel requires the greatest skill. Specialists in making spinning wheels have been known in Utsjoki since at least the middle of the previous century.-- Whoever sees a good tree in the forest 468 can mark it by carving a notch in the trunk, if he is not able to fell the tree right away (I. Rein.). Different type, of trees, such as pine, birch, straight, and curved trees, are felled at the same time and loaded in a sled. At home the wood is piled near the left wall of the hut. The work is done out-of-doors. The working place ( feärrâm-sâddi ) is located at a distance of about one-half a lasso from the hut to the left of the door. A big log ( f. pel'ko ) marks the place. The place for cutting firewood ( t[unknown] suollâm-sâddi ) is situated a little further off, marked also by a log ( smahk'ko-muonâ ). In the evening the men carve small objects in the hut. Bigger objects, such as keels for sleds and boats, sledges, and skis, are made out-of-doors when the weather permits. Formerly the reindeer herders had a free period of about four weeks, beginning in the middle of May, when the reindeer cows were left to roam freely. This period was spent in repairing ( tivvuh ) and building. The wood dried quickly at this time of the year (I. Rein.). The settled lapps carried on woodwork throughout the year. Almost every man is able to make the wooden dishes and other objects needed in the household, but special masters ( t[unknown] seähp'pi “smith”) are needed for making sleds and boats.

If a big male attacks an?rily, the man has to run behind a tree or bush, with one hand grabbing hold of its antlers, while the other grabs the lower jaw between the incisors and the molars. 2 If the jaw is squeezed and the antler is pressed from the middle while raising the jaw, the animal may be thrown to the ground, as it cannot now make resistance. If the male is caught by lasso, as it usually is, one man turns the antlers slowly but strongly until they touch the ground, then he “twists” ( pońâstih , teäd'dili? ) and the male is down, lying on its right flank. [Page 251] The other man sits down on top of it, astride, pressing down the antlers and turning the faw upwards. The feller jumps to bite, lying down on all fours, with his head between the animal's legs. The castrator has to have strong, unbroken teeth; even some women habe been able to do this. The testicles ( p[unknown] alluh ) are bitten either bare, or, more rarely, through a mitten, until they burst; then, carefully biting and squeezing with the fingers, they are “ground ( t[unknown] sar'vuh ) to spawn” and pressed under the surrounding skin to be reabsorbed by the connective tissues. A skilled man may castrate about ten reindeer a day, but he is capable of doing this only a few days a week, otherwise his maxillary joints will soften. A certain reindeer-Lapp said in the evening after work: “today it was a hard job ( pâr'gu “work”), I “bit” eleven males ( käs'kem )”. Two or three castrations may be executed every day. Young boys begin to practice at fifteen years and go on as long as their teeth are sound. Sometimes the castration is made with a knife; this method has also to be used if the scrotum bursts while biting. However, it is said that such a reindeer becomes velvet-antlered, has poor appetite and is weak and easily tired.

The sorcerer ( nóai'di ) was an important person, a healer as well as a sacrificial priest, who was able to repel evil and obtain insight into the gods' wills. Some were sorcerers by innate talent; they were taught by the spirits through illnesses. The first case of illness would occur during childhood; the second - in youth - increased their wisdom, and the third, occurring during the years of manhood, gave the finishing touches to the skill. The sorcerer rarely [Page 645] held his position beyond his 50th year. He had to be in perfect health, since the loss of even one tooth meant that he was no longer considered fully competent. 1 A certain amount of sorcerer's knowledge was passed on from father to son, and additional knowledge could be obtained through practice, even if such a practitioner never attained first-class competence. The flying sorcerers ( kir'di-nóai'di ) were the most eminent, as they were able to fly like gusts or birds, and also to appear in the shapes of other animals. The trance-sorcerers were of another class, as their souls were held to be able to move outside their bodies during uncon-sciousness, e.g. in the shape of an animal, wolf, bear, wild reindeer or fish. If such an animal was then injured, it remained forever in the sorcerer's body. The less talented sorcerers were considered able to bring back such things as stolen goods through the mere power of the word or by other means. There were benevolent as well as evil sorcerers, as was the case with their assistant spirits ( nóaide-k[unknown] adtsih ). ...
A certain merchant from Tornio wanted to test the skill of a Lapp and promised him a reward if he could send his spirit to Tornio, about 70 miles away. When the Lapp had drunk some liquor, he fell into a trance and made the journey to and fro in one hour. He had visited the merchant's house, taken along his wife's gold ring and other objects, and told the most reliable details about his visit. The merchant took the objects, and after his return home asked his wife if she had lost them. The latter acknowledged that it had happened on the very day the Lapp had been sent to the house.
J. Fellman gives many examples of well-known sorcerers' skills. The Inari-Lapp Kuvva once escorted wild reindeer from Kittilä to Inari, but Peiva[unknown] s sent them back (according to another version the animals were escorted from the districts of Tuntsa and Kouta). Once when the sorcerer P[unknown] avu[unknown] s-Niila “transferred,” while singing in the Lapp fashion, an enormous wild reindeer herd from Kolt-Lapland to Utsjoki, where there had been no wild reindeer before, they were followed by Kolt-Lapp sorcerers in the shape of three wild reindeer males. But Niila's sister, a famous sorceress, [Page 647] swished her skirts and out of them came nine wolves that rushed at the three males. Niila and his sister attached a wild reindeer female, saying: “even the grandson will find a wild reindeer at this place.”

The Second is to find out a proper Remedy, viz . what Sort of Sacrifice will be most pleasing to their Gods, but especially to Storjunkare , without whose peculiar Favour they never hope to recover their Health. The beforementioned Author proceeds thus: This done, the Patient must make a Vow of a certain Sacrifice, of a Raindeer, Buil, He-Goat or Ram, or something else of this Kind, to be offered to some certain Storjunkare, dwelling in some certain Mountain or other . Neither is it left to the Choice of the Patient, but to the direction of the Drum-beater; it being his Province to prescribe, what they ought to do. Whatever the Drummer orders the Patient to do , says the same Author, he must perform, and either Sacrifice immediately, or at least promise to offer such a Sacrifice at a certain appointed Time . For it is the Business of him, who beats the Drum, to enquire (as I told you before) which of the Gods the Sacrifice is to be offered to, and what kind of Sacrifice will be acceptable to him; for the same Sacrifice is not pleasing to every one of their Gods, neither is the same God satisfied with one kind of Sacrifices at all times; so that the choice of it depends on the Manager of the Drum, whose direction the sick Person is to follow. The manner of performing it, is thus described by Samuel Rheen: When they pretend to Cure any Distemper by the help of the Drum, it is done in the following manner: The Patient must present the Drummer with two Rings, as a Reward for his Pains, one of Brass, the other of Silver; both which he tyes to his right Arm. The Drummer, after having put those two Rings in the same Bunch, [Page 148] which commonly is made use of, as often as the Drum is employed for those Purposes, beats the said Drum, singing all the while, as do likewise all the Men and Women there present, the first with a loud Voice, the latter somewhat lower . From the Motion and Position of the Rings, the Drum-beater makes his Conjecture, as we told you before. Lundius gives the following Account concerning this Method: If a Laplander happen to fall Sick in the Lapmark of Uma , they send for the next Neighbour, whom they think most expert in the management of the Drum. The first Thing to be done after his coming is, to Sacrifice one of the best Raindeer, belonging to the sick Body, or to his best Friend; then he begins to beat his Drum, and falling on the Ground, remains there for some time unmoveable, his Body being as hard as a Stone. In the mean while the rest there present sing a certain Song, which they have been taught by him beforehand, till he recovers his Senses, arises, takes up his Drum, and holding it up to his Head, beats it softly for some small time. After which he sits down very pensive, and begins to give them an Account of his Transactions; he tells them, that he has passed thro' the Body of the Terrestrial Globe, where he has met with the Antipodes, being conducted by his Genius, among a People of a very handsome and venerable Aspect; those People, he says, being advertised of his coming, had shut their Gates against him, but that by the affistance of his Genius, he had got among them thro' a Hole, where he had seen something belonging to the Sick Person, either his Hat, his Shoes, or perhaps his Mittens, or some such like Thing, which he was either able or unable to bring away. Their gencral Opinion is, That if the Drummer did bring it away, there is great Hopes of the Patients recovery, but if not, that he will Dye, and endure a great deal of Pain. And because they are fully persuaded, that the Soul of the Drummer does actually leave his Body and is carried to the Place he Names to them; they say that his Soul is brought back by his Genius over the highest Rocks and Mountains, with such swiftness, that the Sand and Stones doe flye about like Hail. Mr. Paul Venetus relates something not unlike this of the Tartars of the Province of Areladam . And these are the Things commonly performed by this Drum.

Most villager conjurers (again Branko is an exception) have an articulated aesthetic concerning the right way to accomplish all tasks. In snake-bite rituals, as with all Serbian healing rites, not only must the procedure be repeated three times, as we have seen, but the entire process must be done on each of three successive days. People say it should be done after noon, when the sun begins its journey downward (another mythic theme), carrying off the trouble with the waning day (Kerewsky-Halpern and Foley 1978a:922).
Once, I remember, the owner of a sick cow couldn’t wait until noon. Well before daybreak one rainy morning he goaded his sick cow down the lane, across the cornfields, and into the dark, muddied yard. I heard Branko curse and get out of bed. He grabbed a flashlight and hurried to get on with it — he too felt no need to wait until noon, and in any case his rest was already disrupted. He yelled for me to get my flashlight and come out to the yard, where he was flicking raindrops off his nose and racing through the three recitations of the charm.
That part completed, we went with both flashlights down to a gully behind his pasture to obtain a ritual accessory. What is required is a small branch of leskova drva hazel (Corylus Avellana), valued as a restorative wood, nut-bearing and therefore life-giving. 13 We slogged up from the gully with the requisite branch, and Branko stripped it and fashioned it into a small cross, stooping to pull out a blade of long grass along the fence to use to bind the twigs. He placed the cross on the cow’s rump and suddenly remembered that he was supposed to perform the incantations with the cross in place. Muttering an oath under his breath, he repeated the charm three times, with an aside to me that it was a good thing I wasn’t recording it because it was not kako treba as it should be . “Ali ako,” he said ( But what of it ).
13 The name Ora[unknown]sac derives from orah walnut . That nut-bearing tree is relatively abundant in the village and is not considered to have restorative power equivalent to hazel. For an exploration of the spirits who reside in trees and wood see Bynum (1978). “Knock on wood” in our own culture is an identical response to this ancient belief.
Under usual conditions, after the placement of the cross and the performance of the charm the three times, the cow’s ears are lifted and the practitioner blows into them “to make sure she has heard the words.” Then the owner is instructed on subsequent treatment. The inflamed area is to be beaten lightly (massaged) with boughs of burjan dwarf elder (Sambucus ebulus), readily found throughout the village and known to herbalists for its soothing qualities. The next day the calf is put to suck or the inflamed teat milked (a procedure beneficial in mastitis). And, after three days of repetition of the charm and the rest, the “snake bite” subsides. Evil is banished, and in addition Branko’s reputation is reinforced.

The third outstanding manipulative method of restoring the viscera to their proper place is distinctly curious. The treatment is a specialist monopoly. At Kralje the doctor rubs the veins and arteries of the left arm, from hand to elbow. At Vare[unknown]s, in Bosnia, he takes hold of the arteries in the patient’s back between the thumb and first finger, and follows the course of the blood vessels with pressure above them to the armpit, or starting from between the thumb and first finger traces those which lead up the left arm. Elsewhere vigorous rubbing between the thumb and finger of the left hand is considered to be curative, or rubbing the muscles under the left shoulder blade. Again, the operator places his own thumb and first finger between the patient’s left thumb and first finger, and presses upwards as hard as he can. If the patient is unable to bear or withstand the pressure, it is a sign that he is suffering from strunja . The doctor plucks at the blood vessels under the armpit in Serbia. The doctor rubs the arteries down the left palm of the patient, following the inner side of the arm up to the biceps, and where the blood vessels appear to form a knot he catches hold of the flesh and pinches it firmly between his fingers, while an assistant fastens a cord tightly round the arm at that point. The patient should then lie on his left arm, perfectly still for a couple of hours, until the arm is numbed. The bandage is then loosened a little, and the patient again lies down in the same position. What the theoretical connection may be between the displacement of the viscera and the blood vessels of the left side of the body is not clear.

This last point deserves some discussion. When a young Kuna becomes a disciple of an experienced curing specialist he places himself in a thoroughly submissive position with regard to his teacher. Once the branch of knowledge he wishes to learn has been decided upon and fixed, the specialist controls the manner in which instruction proceeds, the sequence in which all knowledge is passed out, and the topics to be discussed during each session. The first stages usually deal with etiquette, the most important rule at this point being that the student should refrain from asking questions. The duties and responsibilities of a curing specialist are detailed and stressed: he should be humble, the corollary being that he should respect his teacher; he should not undertake to learn ritual knowledge for selfish reasons; and he should never criticize other specialists (a rule that is contradicted a good deal in actual fact).
When learning proper begins, the student characteristically listens attentively to a short portion of a chant several times, then is told to repeat it. When he has mastered this task adequately, another piece of the chant is given to him in the same fashion, and he repeats it. On and on it goes until the entire chant has been learned. As the student progresses and demonstrates his capacity for learning he is given information or symbols and their underlying meanings, commentaries on the nature of curing and disease in general, and instruction in accompanying ritual. Such information is conveyed to the student either by demonstration or verbally. [Page 48] But the important point is that it is done when the teacher -- not the student -- considers the time is right. If the professor wants to discourse on the domain of a particular spirit residing in the jungle, he will do so, and on his own time. If he wants to collect medicines one day, the student may follow along. And if he decides to pass on some esoteric information about the plants being gathered -- or if he decides not to -- that is the way things will happen. Instruction is paced, regulated, and nothing comes before its time: the deepest meanings, the most intricate and sensitive details, all are left until the student has demonstrated his soundness of character and his capacity to handle the knowledge in question.

It was difficult for most of the specialists to conceive of a different system of teaching, and until I managed to adapt myself (at least partially) to their expectations it was apparent that they considered me a strange bird indeed. As I was working with small gifts and favors (such as assisting them on their farms or fishing), which was the same sort of arrangement they enjoyed with their regular students, I was expected to fall in line. While they continued to view me as fundamentally different from their usual students and generally put up with my obtuse habit of asking too many questions, it rapidly became clear that they felt more confortable if I sat back and listened to what they had to say. Whenever I initiated a session with a simple question like “Is X a kind of curing chant?,” the answer frequently lasted for half an hour or longer [Page 49] and ran across terrain far afield of my original focus. In the end, to cut down on frustration on all sides, I adopted the tactic of identifying a general topic and letting the specialist develop it as he saw fit, or even waiting for a topic to arise in the course of casual conversation and letting it proceed naturally with no more than a few interjections for clarification. Of course, things changed as my knowledge of curing grew. With most specialists, the monologues became less frequent and I was able to direct the sessions more along my own lines, filling in gaps with more specific information. But my schooling was still largely in their hands. Some of the specialists even occasionally produced lectures on subjects they thought I should know, gauging them closely to my level of understanding at the time.

The Baptist doctor stationed at the hospital in Ailikanti once told me (in rebuttal to the belief that primitive peoples are without mental illness) that he had recently run across two men who were, in his words, “insane.” One man, he said, claimed to have an eagle clawing at his chest, while the second man complained of having an armadillo in his back. It turned out [Page 110] that the man with the eagle was suffering from jabbing chest pains which had been diagnosed by a Kuna specialist as the claws of an eagle poni digging into his purpa. Years earlier, he had ingested the heart of an eagle to improve his hunting skills, and the spiritual eagle, which had been incorporated into his purpa, had turned upon him. The other man was afflicted with an armadillo poni which had crept inside his purpa and was rolling itself in a ball, thus causing him to walk about with his shoulders bent forward.

A common medium through which ponikana [spirits causing ailments] attack is dreams, for all dreams are set in the realm of spirit. In this realm, the purpa of a sleeping individual sometimes journeys far afield into unfamiliar landscapes populated with strange beings and filled with peril. Ritual specialists, in particular, are [Page 113] subject to dreams in which their purpakana visit the domains of dangerous spirits, and while the specialists sometimes learn from these excursions there is always a good measure of risk involved. One specialist recounted to me a dream in which he ventured into the bowels of a huge ship, passed two growling jaguars tethered by stout chains, and came to a bare room in which a sinister man with the face of a bat was biting a woman on the neck. The specialist rapidly retreated to the surface and made his way to shore. The same man said that on several occasions he had been invited, while dreaming, to drop down into the lower levels of the cosmos, but had always declined the invitiations out of fear.
From time to time, dangerous spirits appear in human form, catching the unsuspecting dreamer off guard and tricking him into indiscretions which result in purpa damage. Several years ago, a young woman from Ustuppu dreamed that she had sexual intercourse with a youth she had never seen before. She told no one of this nocturnal affair, and after some three months gave birth to a clutch of turtle eggs. Her mother found out but decided, unwisely, to maintain secrecy. Shortly thereafter, the neighbors began to hear water gurgling beneath the ground, and a rumor spread that the ponikana living there were offended by some human infraction and were going to send a tidal wave over the island. Somehow, the girl’s dream became known and was immediately connected to the subterranean noises. A nele (‘seer’) peered into the spirit world and discovered that [Page 114] the girl’s sexual partner had not been a man, but a sea turtle poni in disguise. 7 Another woman in the Cartí region became pregnant and gave birth to a child with huge red eyes, claws, and thick hair covering most of its body. She had likewise engaged in sexual intercourse with a stranger while dreaming, and the stranger had turned out to be a whale poni. 8
7 This woman was taken to a small uninhabited island near the mainland and given medicines to drive the turtle poni out of her system. The medicines were so powerful that she fell into a coma and died.
8 The child either died at birth or was killed by the midwives in the birth house. The woman was given medicines and survived.

Several informants on Ustuppu told me that a person with strong nika emits a noise like a growling motor, which is audible only to the spirits, and that this noise warns the ponikana in the area to stay away. Nordenskiold’s principal informant, Rubén Pérez Kantule, drew for him a picture of “...a person and around him a sort of smoke cloud and afterwards explained that when evil spirits come against this they go around in order to search for an opening and when they fail to find one they cannot get at the person surrounded by niga.” (Ibid.) A strong nika, then, is something like a suit of armor which effectively repels the incursion of dangerous spirits.
When someone has been debilitated by illness his nika is reduced, and it is unwise for him to leave the confines of his home until it has been built up again. If a sick person, or someone who has just recovered from a prolonged bout with ponikana, must venture afield he will often paint his face with achiote to mask his palid appearance and give the ponikana the impression that he is strong and healthy. But even so he will be taking a risk, as the following story demonstrates:
Years ago Peret was ill. His face was washed of color and he was weak, but he decided to go fishing anyway. He painted his face red and paddled out to sea. After having some success he returned to the island and was beaching his canoe when he spotted a large fish just off the rocks. He picked up his spear and tried to stab it, then suddenly grew faint and fell unconscious in the water. Some people standing nearby saw this happen and pulled him out. They managed to revive him, but he ached all over and was shaking. A curing specialist was summoned and ascertained that Peret had been attacked by iwi purwa (‘elephant spirit wind’), [Page 120] which had observed a gap in his protective nika and had taken advantage of the situation. Peret eventually recovered after a series of medicinal baths designed to eliminate the ‘elephant spirit wind’ from his system. If this hadn’t been done he would have gone crazy and died.

Some unlucky individuals are born with an inherent vulnerability to the attacks of specific ponikana, a condition which is called ‘bead necklace’ ( wintup). The bead necklace may be thought of as a spiritual “brand” which is placed around the neck of the fetus in the womb. 11 It is believed that during gestation the spirit of the fetus lives in the house of Muu on the forth level of the cosmos. Muu’s house is also crowded with all manner of spiritual animals, and if the pregnant woman (or one of her close relatives) offends a particular flesh-and-blood animal during gestation, the spirtual counterpart of that animal will either thwart birth, endow the fetus with some of its physical or behavioral characteristics, or leave its mark in the form of the bead necklace. This mark singles the child out for easy attack by the poni in question unless it is discerned early and ‘broken’ by means of special medicines. When a child is born, midwives always search for evidence of a bead necklace, which cannot, of course, be seen in that form. If the umbilical cord is coiled like a snake, the child may have a snake poni bead necklace; if the child is born crouched like a jaguar, the [Page 121] jaguar poni has most likely left his mark; and so forth. Sometimes the bead necklace is not discerned at birth, and it is only after a person has a series of a close brushes with a particular kind of animal or spirit that the nature of his affliction is inferred.
11 Bead necklaces are common symbols in Kuna medical beliefs. It was noted earlier in this chapter that kiatakkalet spirits often place sickness necklaces around their victim’s necks. Ponikana often use this technique; and the curing spirits marshalled by the curing specialists frequently place necklaces on ponikana to subdue them.

Curing specialists are highly vulnerable to the attacks of ponikana because their dealings with them are typically prolonged and intimate. Although their knowledge of the spirits and the workings of the spirit realm usually serves to protect them from mishaps, occasional mistakes or indiscretions can bring on disaster. Specialists who overstep their capabilities and attempt to do too much with limited knowledge are inviting misfortune. For example, one man from Cartí tried to learn ‘The Way of Muu’ ( Muu Ikar), one of the most powerful of Kuna curing [Page 124] chants, before he was old enough; 14 he was overcome by Muu, who caused him to vomit blood, and he died shortly thereafter. Occasionally, men who work with ‘demon medicine’ ( nia ina) or with the chant called ‘The Way of the Demon’ ( Nia Ikar), are attacked by demons when they reach old age and their nika is on the wane. Other specialists who let their own spirits travel too freely among the ponikana to learn chants and medicines become contaminated by the company they keep.
14 Most specialists say that to learn ‘The Way of Muu’ one must already be a grandfather.
When important curing ceremonies are undertaken, both the specialist in charge and the patient -- and, in some cases, everyone who participates -- are expected to observe the rules surrounding the ceremony with care. Failure to do so displays a blatant disrespect for the curing spirits enlisted as helpers, and when such transgressions are committed the spirits are likely to take offense and retaliate. Some breaches of etiquette are minor, and the curing spirits will simiply refuse to cooperate, thus rendering the ceremony ineffective. But more flagrant transgressions will often send them against the participants in a fury. One of the most serious of these violations occurs when the specialist or the patient engages [Page 125] in sex during the course of the ceremony. 15 This point is well illustrated in the ritual called Nek Apsoket (‘Conversing with the Place’), which is performed to exorcise large numbers of ponikana that have attacked the entire community. During this eight-day ceremony, no one in the village may engage in sex (or even have close contact with members of the opposite sex), and to stress this rule, men and women eat and sleep apart. In this case, it is the leaders of the ceremony who stand to be punished for the sexual transgression of any village members, and the result is often death. One specialist in the region of Niatuppu, to the West of Ustuppu, suffered a massive nose bleed and died because someone in the village committed an indiscretion (Howe: personal communication, 1976). And several years ago, a famous Apsoket chanter from Ustuppu reportedly succumbed to the very same ponikana he was attempting to exorcise when his spirit helpers, offended by the sexual behavior of two participants, stopped protecting him. 16
15 The specialist must abstain from sex the night before the ceremony begins, and continue until it is finished. The Kuna say the the spirits of most medicines are women. They stand about the hammock of the patient, protecting him from ponlkana and administering his medicines. When the medicine spirits are engaged in such activities, they will brook no competition for the affections of either the specialist or the patient. It is clear, however, that no curing spirits, male or female, tolerate sex during curing ceremonies.
16 This particular ceremony was performed to combat an epidemic of fever (diagnosed as malaria by the doctor from the Ailikanti hospital) in the village of Kalet, on the mainland near the Colombian border. The doctor himself, who was given reluctant entrance by villagers, also fell ill.

Certain animals are considered especially dangerous, and for this reason contact with them should be kept to a minimum or avoided altogether. The rattlesnake ( ukkunaipe) is said to be the friend of the Kuna, and should not be harmed, for its spirit is employed by snake medicine specialists to procure medicines to combat snake ponikana. But if someone foolishly kills a rattlesnake, it has the ability to send its purpa (which is frequently clothed in substance) to attack its killer. 17 A snake hawk called wekko, 18 if wounded, will call to all the snakes in the jungle to pursue and bite the hunter. Simply seeing a coral snake ( masarnaipe) will bring on the death of someone in the viewer’s immediate family. Such disagreeable animals as crocodiles, large sharks, and octopuses are quick to launch spirit attacks if they are touched or disturbed. 19 Similarly, sloths and tree anteaters should not be touched or killed, as they are likely to launch spiritual attacks and bring on weaknesses. Certain types of red animals, most of them birds, should be left alone, for they cause complications involving bleeding. Ritual specialists may confront these animals directly or even kill them for use as medicines; but [Page 127] this can be done only because the specialists know the “secrets” ( purpa, wilup) of the animals and their knowledge gives them power over their spirits. 20
20 These “secrets” are short, spoken “origin histories” such as the one for genipa mentioned in the last chapter. They tell the spirits that the specialist knows all about them, and thus demonstrate that has them in his power. The Kuna often label these “origin histories” with the Spanish term “Secreto.”

When epidemics of diarrhea, fever, pustules, and skin disease sweep through Kuna communities, it is believed that groups of ponikana have become angry with the entire population because one or more persons have violated their sanctuary. 22 There are poni sanctuaries everywhere -- in swamps, in thick stretches of jungle, in pools alongside the islands -- that are well-known to virtually all Kuna adults. Certain regions on the mainland are strictly excluded from farming activities (although medicines may be gathered at these places freely and without danger) for fear of molesting the spirits. Certain large trees belong to specific groups of ponikana, who stretch their clotheslines among the branches. 23 If these trees are chopped down, the ponikana become furious, and forthwith invade the community of the man who has offended them. Sometimes the violation of a poni sancturay is done unwittingly, as occured when an individual living on Ustuppu dug deep holes for the foundation of a cement house and impinged on the territory of a group of ponikana living under the ground. Most poni [Page 129] sanctuaries, however, are well known to village members, and are disturbed only by people who lack experience or who refuse to be cautious. A few years ago, a man from Ustuppu mistakenly (so he claimed) burned down a tree belonging to a band of snake ponikana while clearing a plot for a corn farm. Several days later, a young man was fatally bitten by a snake as he was working on a nearby communal farm. During the next week, people spotted snakes throughout the mainland and a couple of the creatures even appeared on the island. The snakes, it was concluded, had broken loose from their home and were venting their fury on the entire community.
22 The pustules are symptoms of smallpox, which until recently was commom in San Blas. The spirit which causes it is called ai sapet (‘loving friend’), for he jumps from one person to the next. When ‘loving friend’ attacks, the community is sealed off and no one is allowed to leave or arrive from other communities.
23 For someone who wants to chop down one of these trees there is a chant called Mortup Okwaet Ikar (‘The Way of Changing the Clothes-lines’). The specialist who performs this chant changes the clothes-lines to another tree and placates the spirits.

The nele (‘seer,’ ‘shaman’; plural form: nerkan or nelekana) enjoys a unique status in Kuna society and stands apart from all other ritual specialists by virtue of his possession of supernatural powers. The nele has the ability to send his purpa on journeys into the world of spirit and to communicate freely with its inhabitants. He is also recognized as the master diagnostician of illness, for he is equipped [Page 138] with a supernatural ‘lens’ ( ispe) which enables him to peer directly into the spiritual makeup of his fellow men. The nele is distinguished further from other specialists on the gronds that his abilities are held to be innate, having been formed by Muu inside his mother’s womb. 6 All other ritual professions can be learned by anyone with the capacity and disposition for study, but only those born with what is termed a nele kurkin are allowed to pursue careers as nerkan. 7 Women may also be nerkan, and this is the only profession within the field of curing, aside from that of midwife, that they can hold. 8
6 Muu forms the personality of humans in the womb by educating the spirit of the fetus. For this reason, everyone’s personality is in a sense innate. On the other hand, Muu does not teach chants or medicinal knowledge. All she does is create the appropriate disposition for such learning. Fetuses destined to be nerkana, however, are given their supernatural powers in the womb (although these powers must be developed more fully after birth).
7 The kurkin is a spiritual entity which determines a person’s capacity or predisposition. See Chapter Six and the Glossary for a more thorough explanation of kurkin.
8 There are three nerkan presently living on Ustuppu, and all three are women. A few women fill ritual positions in the puberty ceremony, but this is not considered by the Kuna to be within the field of curing.

He (Pérez) was out in the forest and experienced a fright. Having returned to his hut he felt fever coming on, and the next day he was rather ill. Pérez did not know what kind of illness he was suffering from, and his people asked him to given an account of the dreams he had during the night. He then told them that he had dremt that he had revisited the place in the forest where had been the day before. His people then expressed the opinion that his purba had been ravished by some evil spirit. The fever increased, and each time he dropped off to sleep he dreamt of the same spot in the forest. His people then called in a person who, by means of the Spanish pepper chant, ( kaburr tulet 28 ), knew how to dispatch the protective spirits on their quest to rescue the ravished purba. (Nordenskiold 1938:335).
28 Nordenskiold was confused. The name of this chant is Kapur Ikar (‘The Way of Spanish Pepper’); the specialist who knows this chant is referred to as kapur tulet (‘Spanish pepper man’).

In cases of purpa abduction the intensity of fever is also an important element in diagnosis. Ponikana have domains on the surface of the (spiritual) earth, but they also maintain quarters on other levels of the cosmos to which they can travel at will. The deeper ponikana journey into the levels with the stolen purpa, the more serious the condition of the patient becomes. Generally, the mildest fever indicates that the ponikana still have the purpa hostage on the surface; as the fever grows in intensity, the specialists assume that the ponikana are retreating down through the levels. 31 Information as to the depth to which the ponikana have taken the purpa is of vital importance, for the curer must know where to send his spiritual helpers to retrieve it. Although it may be known, for example, that crocodile ponikana residing at the mouth of a particular river are responsible, a search on the surface would be futile if in fact the purpa has been taken to the second [Page 164] level. Thus, complete diagnosis in cases of purpa abduction entails not only the identity of the thieving ponikana (which depends primarily on the patient’s recent actions), but also knowledge of the level on which the ponikana are holding the purpa (which is based on the intensity of the symptoms).
31 There is difference of opinion on this matter among specialists in Ustuppu and Okop Sukkun. Some begin their search for the purpa on the third level, no matter what the intensity of the fever. They do not even look on the surface. A number of other specialists, however, claim that if the purpa is taken as far as the third level, it cannot be recovered and the patient will die.

In summary, diagnosis is a complex process of inference which sifts through available evidence and attempts to establish the identity of the poni or ponikana which have caused the [Page 167] illness in question. At times, diagnosis is simple and the treatment based upon it is successful. This demonstrates to the Kuna conclusively that the diagnosis was correct. Occasionally, however, the evidence is less clear, and the Kuna are left with several competing interpretations. The most desirable strategy at this point is to enlist the aid of a nele (seer), who possesses the power to scan the purpa of the victim and view the problem directly. But even the nele may err, and when the patient fails to respond to treatment, new attempts at diagnosis must be undertaken. When a range of possibilities exists, several different hypothesis are occasionally maintained and used as a basis for treatment.
An example of this occurred two years ago in Ustuppu. A well-known medicine man was violently stricken by a poni which produced a corroding skin rash over much of his body, nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, and a drastic loss of weight. He was restricted to his hammock and within two weeks he was reduced to skin and bones. As his condition grew more severe, three alternate diagnoses were proposed, and all of them were kept alive as working hypothesis. It was first seen as significant that the medicine man had fallen ill within a week of performing a ceremony to ‘cool the purpa’ ( purpa ottammimakket) of a four year-old girl. During the ceremony, which lasted four days and demanded the participation of the girl’s family members, a group of children had been allowed to run about, joke loudly among themselves, and generally raise [Page 168] havoc. It was believed that the spirits of the medicines used during the ceremony may have become offended by this lack of discipline and had turned in retaliation on the chanter. The second hypothesis proceeded from the fact that the patient had been actively involved in the revolution of 1925. Because he had seen Panamanian national guardsmen killed, the ‘assassin’ poni had infected him, and now, years later, it had begun to ravage his spirit. The final hypothesis centered on the fact that the patient was adept with nia medicine. Because this profession brings the specialist into intimate contact with the powerful nia spirits, it is highly dangerous. While the medicine man was usually protected by his knowledge of medicines, somehow his guard had dropped -- perhaps because he was old and his nika was low -- and a nia was attacking his purpa.

Two skills are given particularly high value among Kuna ritual specialists: a thorough knowledge of the features of the [Page 190] spirit world, and an ability to articulate this knowledge in a coherent, comprehensive, and pleasing manner. The Kuna believe that in order to control the course of events in the world of spirit -- and, consequently, in the world of substance -- one must be able to tell the spirits about themselves. A specialist must demonstrate to the spirits that he knows who they are, how they came into being, what their physical and behavioral characteristics are, where they live, and what their names are. Such information comprises what is called the purpa. In this context, the word purpa means something more than ‘spirit’ or ‘soul’. It refers to the underlying essence of things, the most fundamental facts of existence. And only by knowing the purpa of something can one control it.
The word purpa also labels a genre of short “origin histories” which describe the birth of various important spirits from the womb of the Great Mother. 18 For reasons no one could explain to me, these origin histories are in colloquial Kuna, not the language of the spirit world. Their content is blatantly sexual, and because they are perfectly intelligible to non-specialists they are closely guarded by the specialist who [Page 191] know them. 19 Origin histories are not chanted, but rather an spoken softly or merely thought through in the presence of the spirits (see Nordenskiold 1938:346). In theory, all things have purpa histories, for all things were born from the Great Mother at the time of creation. In actual fact, however, only a handful of purpa histories of ‘principal’ spirits are known and used by Kuna specialists. Some of these deal with the origins of powerful medicinal spirits such as genipa, balsawood, Spanish pepper, cacao, and ‘grandmother string’ ( muutup); 20 others involve prominent inhabitants of the world of spirit such as Muu and Uncle Kwetuli (see discussion of Apsoket Ikar in Chapter Seven). There are also purpa histories for things such as snakes, centipedes, wasps, scorpions, and bars of incandescent steel.
19 Sexual matters are never discussed publically. While I was doing fieldwork, several teenage boys discovered some of these origin histories written in a specialist’s notebook. They were caught reading them to their friends, some of whom were girls. The culprits were severely punished, and the book was locked up.

Before describing the three qualitative classes of medicine in greater detail, a few words should be said about Kuna botany. Most accomplished specialists have an extensive knowledge of the botanical resources which surround them. Much of this knowledge deals with “natural” family groupings of plants, which serve to guide medicine men in selecting medicines. However, as will be seen, the selection of medicines is frequently based on entirely different considerations.
The Kuna divide the plant kingdom into three general classes: ‘trees’ ( sappiwalakan), ‘vines’ ( tupakan), and ‘small plants and bushes’ ( kakan or purkan). Those versed in ritual history explain that during the creation the Great Mother and the Great Father came together to give birth to all of the plants and place them or earth. They did this ‘in lines’ ( ile ile), which is to say that they placed them in orderly fashion, one after the other, family by family. There is a good deal of confusion among different specialists as to what the precise order of creation was, but the composition of the individual family groups is generally agreed upon. Thus, the original couple sent all of the trees with hard hearts in a group. one after the other, and they represent a single family. Similarly, [Page 225] all of the black palms with spines came together, as did the trees with abundant white sap, the trees with foul-smelling bark, the trees with spines, the bitter trees, the foul-smelling vines, the vines with spines, the bitter vines, the plants which yield red coloring, a group of small plants which grow along the river banks, the sweet-smelling plants, the chile peppers, and so forth.
Membership in a particular family group is based on the presence or absence of one or more shared attributes, such as degree of hardness, color, possession of spines, smell, and taste. These attributes are closely related to function. Thus, trees with hard hearts are used as posts for house construction and as medicine for making the nika strong. The black palms with spines are employed in house construction, for making fishing spears, bows and arrow tips; as medicines they are used to strengthen nika, to combat ponikana which cause sharp jabbing pains, and to aid in recovering abducted purpakana. The chile peppers are used as condiments with meals, and as medicines to ‘confuse the road’ that ponikana take to the purpa. When the attributes of two or more different family groups are similar, the families are seen as distinct yet closely related, for they perform the same medicinal functions. Thus, although foul-smelling vines and trees are obviously different in a botanical sense, they are considered functionally equivalent. Both serve to confuse the road taken by ponikana, and are therefore often mixed together in a single medical preparation.
Skilled medicine men have a thorough knowledge of the different plant families and their functional attributes. Such knowledge is essential in organizing medical treatments, for there is often a correspondence between “natural” botanical categories and their medicinal counterparts. The following examples, taken from the notebooks of several medicine men on Ustuppu, illustrate this point: 8
8 I did not identify most of these plants according to the Western botanical scheme, and therefore leave them with Kuna names. It is sufficient here merely to note the criterial attributes of the family groups as seen by the Kuna.

As with the dangerous animal medicines, preparations involving sappi karta and muutup sometimes produce unintended results of a disastrous nature. For example, a number of years ago in the Cartí region, a man treated himself with sappi karta in order to learn curing chants. While sleeping at night, his purpa travelled to a region of the spirit world and undertook a study of chants under the direction fo the sappi karta spirit. Before long, the man from Cartí was afflicted with a series of splitting headaches, and although he discontinued treatment he had by this time become Kiatakkalet. Since this misfortune, he has been accused of trying to kill villagers in their dreams on no fewer than four different occasions, and while he is presently a highly respected curing specialist, his reputation as kiatakkalet is widely known.

All of the dangerous medicines, animal and non-animal alike, are used either to acquire behavioral traits which carry prestige or to force an individual to act contrary to his will. Thus, a man skilled in chanting or public speaking stands out as a superior member of the community, as does a particularly adept hunter or fisherman. And while medical preparations used to attract others are sometimes justifiable -- as when, for example, a mother wants her son to return from an extended stay in Panama City -- the motivation lurking behind this type of medicine is typically tinged with selfishness. By contrast, non-dangerous medicines do not confer qualities which bring prestige to the user; neither do they impinge on the lives of others. For example, among those animal medicines which are not considered dangerous, leaf-cutter ant medicine transforms the user into a strong, diligent worker. These are qualities which are expected of all Kuna men, not those which are restricted to a select few. By the same token, women who ingest hummingbird ashes and green moray eel meat during pregnancy are not [Page 244] interested in gaining prestige; they are simply taking sensible steps to avoid complications during childbirth.

In colloquial Kuna the word kurkin means ‘hat.’ In the language of the spirits, however, its meaning is less easy to define. The term is sometimes used to refer to a spiritual hat resting on the head of a particular spirit, a magical hat that stands for the special knowledge and power possessed by its owner. 72 However, the most prominent meaning of kurkin pertains to the intellectual and creative capacity of an individual, and in this sense it designates his “spiritual brain.” 73 At the same time, kurkin may refer to a person’s personality, any special aptitudes he may have, or to his unique bent of mind. Everyone has a kurkin, and it is said of those who have learned several prestige skills that they have multiple [Page 297] kurkin. For example, skilled chanters have kurkin for chanting; and those who have established reputations as public speakers, hunters, canoe makers, artists or medicine men also have kurkin for their respective specialities. A person’s kurkin also determines the contours of his personality. Someone who is stingy, irascible, or quarrelsome is said to have a defective kurkin. 74
72 In a number of curing chants the spirit helpers of the chanters are described as wearing eight hats. They also wear eight coats, eight vests, eight pairs of shoes, eight pairs of pants, etc. (as these clothes are spiritual, there is no problem in putting them on; of course, eight pairs of substantial shoes would cause greater difficulties). The hats, along with the other articles of clothing, point to the fact that the spirit helpers are formidably powerful characters.
73 The kurkin is not a spiritual counterpart of the substantial brain. The substantial brain is called nono sakwar.
74 There is another metaphorical meaning of kurkin which isn’t easily explained. When a woman is pregnant it is said that she ‘has a kurkin’ ( kurkin nikka). This expression is used to disguise her condition from young people, who shouldn’t know about such things.
The kurkin of human beings is initally formed by Muu and her daughters inside the womb, and is therefore innate. 75 However, while a person’s mental abilities and character are to some extent determined at birth, his kurkin can be modified during the course of his life. The parents of children born with a kurkin marking them as nerkan (seers) occasionally administer medicines to nullify this ability; and medicines are used to cancel the characteristics of a kurkin which makes the owner vulnerable to attacks by certain kinds of wild animals and [Page 298] ponikana. 76 By the same token, the kurkin may be damaged by ponikana which launch attacks and bring on headaches, bad dreams, and mental disorders; and people occasionally bring misfortune upon themselves through the irresponsible use of dangerous medicines. In such cases, the kurkin is often corrupted beyond redemption, leaving the user kiatakkalet, suicidal, or half-witted. 77 On the other hand, the kurkin may be improved through the proper use of medicines. The purpose of kurkin medicine is not to make the user more knowledgeable, but rather to develop his abilities for learning. Specific qualities of the medicines are added to the kurkin so that the patient is able to increase his capacity for learning particular specialities.
75 In some of the curing chants ( Kurkin Ikar, Muu Ikar) there are descriptions of Muu and her daughters instructing the spirits of fetuses (‘her children’) to write on pieces of paper. These are their kurkin, which are being developed.
Many of the school-age boys suffer from headaches and poor concentration in the face of rigorous study. The Kuna say that their kurkin is simply too small to incorporate all the new things they are learning, and it needs to be ‘enlarged’ ( otummoe) and ‘opened up” ( onape, ekae). The pain they experience is caused by an abundance of knowledge pushing against the walls of the kurkin; and their inability to concentrate is produced when the kurkin is ‘rising up’ ( ainakkwe), a condition which causes light-headedness. When this occurs, a medicine man skilled in kurkin medicine is approached, and arrangements are made as to when, where, and how treatment should be carried out. The medicine man then collects a varied assortment of plants, prepares them, and informs them [Page 301] of the patient’s difficulties and the manner in which they should work to set things right. Kurkin treatments call for a wide spectrum of medicines, for several tasks must be accomplished.

Two highly structured treatments are those used to cure snake-bite and to enhance intellectual capacity. When a person is bitten by a snake, a crisis situation develops in which both the patient and the entire village become vulnerable to further attack by snake ponikana. Treatments for increasing intelligence, on the other hand, pose no threat to the community. These are private affairs involving the patient and the specialist, but at the same time they must be closely controlled in order to be effective.

Many Kuna medical specialists formerly had small houses constructed in their patios expressly for administering lengthy treatments, but these are rare in Ustuppu and Okop Sukkun today. 79 At present, a person taking kurkin medicine with the aim of increasing his intellectual capacity usually stays in the house of a specialist for the duration of treatment. 80 During this time, the patient is not permitted to leave the premises except to relieve himself. A hammock is strung for him at a quiet end of the house next to a small enclosure covered with leaves and/or pieces of cloth (Figure 21). Inside the enclosure, there is an undersized canoe containing medicinal plants soaking in water, and off to the side are several pots and buckets filled with similar preparations.
79 According to Nordenskiold (1938:364-5), “it is not advantageous to be exposed to the smoke from the fireplaces when one is taking medicinal baths. Therefore Nele (Kantule) is considering the idea of building a special bath house on the nearby uninhabited mainland for the schoolboys of Ustuppu, where each and every one can have his own bathtub can can bathe in medicine which makes it easier for him to learn to read and write.” This was evidently never done.
80 Kurkin medicine may also be given in the home of the patient, but this is not common. One young man told me that he had once taken a kurkin treatment in his own home, and later another in the home of a specialist. Although the same medicine man engineered both treatments, the patient claimed that the one undertaken in the specialist’s home was by far the most effective.
In the process of re-forming a kurkin, strict controls are placed on the patient’s behavior and on the types of food he may eat, for his new spiritual kurkin is believed to be like soft tissue, very delicate, and easily damaged. All of his food, which is sent from his house, is carried either by pre-pubescent girls or women past the reproductive age, and contact with teenage girls and young women is absolutely forbidden. The Kuna say that the spirits of the medicines, which are women, stand guard over the patient and help him bathe when he sits down in the medicine canoe. 82 Competition for [Page 305] the patient’s affections with mortal women of reproductive age would make them jealous, and when this occurs, they often refuse to work for him and the medicines do not function. 83
82 During a kurkin treatment, a boy once dreamed that he saw several strange women standing at the foot of has hammock. When he related this to the specialist, he was told that these were the spirits of the medicine.
83 For this reason, no medicine man may engage in sexual intercourse when he is handling a treatment. Of course, he may associate with women much more freely than the patient.

Shaman Sainakkaselepalele 5 has arrived; his body is growling ‘uurrr,’ his body is firm. Also present are Shaman Katturkkwalele (a tree), Shaman Kattepalele ( kattepwala 6 ), and Shaman Mummupalele ( mummutwala; ‘drunktree’). When the flowers of Shaman Drunktree are blooming, he is wearing a red hat. Shaman Ukkurwalalele ( ukkurwala; balsawood) has arrived from the direction of the rising sun. He was given life by Tiolele at the beginning of time. When men have lost their purpakana they go to him for help. The chanter tells Shaman Balsawood how the men cut his body with their small, well-sharpened knives: they are carving Shaman Balsawood, they are cutting away chunks to from the arms and legs. They throw the chips on the ground, the ground is becoming white. Shaman Balsawood looks just like Kuna men as he is being carved. Long ago Tiolele (Great Father) placed Shaman Balsawood on the earth so Kuna men could use him to recover their abducted purpakana.
5 The specialist who performed this chant did not know what this plant was. As the chants have been passed down from the epoch in which the Kuna lived on the mainland, miles from their present location in San Blas, some of the plants have never been seen by the chanters.

“McKim has given an excellent statement of their status: ‘ Neles are not eminent through chance or any spell of the mysterious. People do not expect the impossible, but they do expect results in keeping with uncommon mentality. They are not venerated, and people frankly criticize failures. A Nele is on trial at all times, and his judgments are repeated freely. The Cuna respects merit, and merit is the greatest homage he pays; but merit must be demonstrated.”’
“The Nele cannot cure himself or members of his own family. Some are said to have developed such tricks of the trade as being able to grasp a red-hot iron, or walk on burning coals; but this is not usual. Their ability lies primarily in their knowledge of esoteric lore, and the supposed ability to communicate with the spirit world at will. They are the recognized experts on spiritual matters. Present day Neles are said to be less powerful than the Neles of the recent past, who are said to have been able to cut down trees by ‘mental projection’ only.”
“The Innatuledi are the true medical practitioners of the Cuna. There are many in each community, perhaps one for each twenty or thirty people--even on the most acculturated islands. None of them claims to know all of the various chants, and the medicines which accompany them. In the event of an illness which they cannot diagnose, they consult other Innatuledis or a Nele. The childbirth medicines are the most important, and the first to be learned. Medicines are primarily learned from teachers, never on vision guests; though some are said to be learned in dreams. Most of the curing depends on nominalism in the chants, and the use of imitative medicines. There is a distinct recognition of the need of sick persons for quiet, coolness, and soothing; and some of the many medicines do appear to have healing virtues. These [197] are discussed in more detail under Curing Systems. One of the prime requisites of these curers is the knowledge of thousands of jungle plants, used in the curing rites. Some of these curers had Perez bring back seeds from Sweden to plant in their gardens. Deer horns are highly valued, and the Innatuledi will pay up to three dollars for a pair which the ordinary Cuna would pay twenty cents for use as a hat rack.”
“Only three Absogedis are at present practicing among the Cuna. They are curers who assume the responsibility for checking disease of epidemic proportions, and are called in to protect entire villages. They charge very high fees, both for actual curing ceremonies and to instruct pupils. They are also the only teachers who can properly instruct a Nele. It is the Absogedi’s magic which protects the Nele’s soul when he sends it to the world of evil spirits to make friends. The village curing ceremonies require knowledge of a chant which requires eight days to sing through. Adjuncts such as the life size figures are used, and their Purba sent in search of the demon afflicting the village.”
“There are many men who only specialize in one or two curing rites, such as headache chanters, snake bite doctors, and fever chanters. The kantules officiate at the puberty ceremonies, and the Masartuledi are the death chanters.”
“There are evil sorcerers, who are at times killed. They are regarded as Neles or other shamans whose kurgin has been spoiled by too much medicine. Usually cured by other medicines, they are recognized through someone’s dream experiences, or through having given a false diagnosis. Wassén (1949, p. 49) states that legendary history lists several female sorcerers.”

Different medicine men can be specialists in different evil spirits. It is obvious that there is no single Indian who knows all medicines, evil spirits, sagas, traditions, and so forth. When I, together with Pérez [the informant], went through the notes made by Slater from the dictation of an absogedi in Ailigandi, it was clear that there was much that was new to him. In these notes one gets a great deal of information about where the protective spirits come from, of which Pérez had not previously wished, or been able, to give any indication. This naturally does not prevent Pérez’ comments on these notes from being very worthwhile, as they are, for the most part, about things with which he was already familiar.
To ask a Cuna Indian, for example, »Do you believe that a human being has a soul?» is absolutely naive. The question cannot be answered with yes or no. We find in the chapter on the soul, purba, the description of a complicated concept. The answer to a question when it is a matter of ideology is to be taken with caution. It is another matter if the question leads to Pérez’ telling what he has done himself in this or that circumstance.
When one discusses anything with Pérez one understands how knowledge is distributed among a few individuals in the Cuna community, and not in such a way that one can know everything. Nele knows the most but his knowledge embraces more than anything else the traditions and medicines. On the other hand he does not understand, for example, picture-writing. Absogedis’ knowledge is also [Page xviii] limited to a certain field. Nele knows the absogedi-song also. Certain persons know only certain songs.
When we study the Cuna Indians’ concepts we must distinguish between the great mass of beliefs and what the Great Seer Nele and the thinking people believe. The Cunas have thus a great many sagas of the usual type such as the story of how they got fire, and the story of the world tree, in which animals take part, speak and behave like people. For Nele and the thinking Indians these stories do not belong to any special field of knowledge, but are more or less known by all the Indians and have no further significance. They don’t believe as the great masses that these mythic Heroes in the shape of animals have actually existed. It is first with Ibeorgun and his followers that this tradition begins as the real history of this people. Ibeorgun does not change himself into an animal and he never does anything which is supernatural. He and his followers are reformers and inventors who build up the Cuna culture, concoct medicines, improve the language, introduce the puberty feasts, and so on. The only supernatural thing which is told about Ibeorgun and the earlier mythie Heroes of this type is that they have come down from heaven and that they have no earthly father or mother.
The Cunas have beautiful stories, rich in imagination, which tell about the wandering of the human soul after death to the kingdom of the dead. Even these are for Nele only stories which he tells to the common Indians, in order to have them believe in them and have their morals built up by them, but he himself does not believe them. Regarding the fate of the soul after death Nele has himself only a vague idea. He confesses to the specially initiated that he doesn’t know where the human souls go when they die. »Nobody knows the soul’s fate after death», Nele has said. ...
All the Cunas believe that animals, plants and stones, as well as people, carry out actions as if they had souls, but it is only a few [Page xx] who have tried to explain to themselves how that can be. Most of them content themselves with the superficial facts and don’t think of the reasons. When one who is eager to learn wants an explanation, he turns in most cases to Nele, who evidently has thought over the problems and who is the main one to carry on the traditions. It is purba that people, plants and animals and certain stones have, but it would not be correct to translate purba merely as soul. The dead person is nagiba, but nagiba is not identical with purba although it is purba, or more correctly purbagana (plural), which has made nagiba. But more of that later on. Here I have only wished to point out the difference between the ideas of those initiated in religious wisdom and the ideas of the great masses, between those who think and those who simply do what everyone else does.
When we study a primitive people’s culture we should not deceive ourselves into thinking that they tell us everything just because they tell very much. Pérez could really not remember either his father’s or mother’s name. On the other hand, he could tell us what his great grandmother was called.»

Olowitinappi (who died in 1975) was a respected ‘chief’s spokesman’ who knew Kuna tradition well. He always attended ‘gatherings’ and spoke occasionally, in a quiet, almost shy manner not typical of ‘gathering house’ speakers. But Olowitinappi’s great love and the realm of his greatest success was medicine and curing. He would often go to the mainland jungle twice a day in order to gather medicinal plants. And he knew a large number of very long curing chants. His knowledge of ‘the way of the basil,’ used for hunting effectiveness, was one of the reasons he was such an excellent hunter. It is not surprising that his reputation was above all that of a ‘medicinal specialist’ and ‘ ikar knower.’ In 1970, Olowitinappi was sent at community expense to an interior jungle village in order to study snake-bite medicine and curing. Manuel Campos (who died in 1974) was a typical curing specialist. He rarely attended ‘gatherings’ and spoke there even more rarely. He much preferred to spend his evenings practicing one of the many chants he knew from memory or one he was still in the process of learning. He would boom these out into the night for family and neighbors all to hear, in addition of course to whatever spirits might be listening.

When a Kuna woman, man, or child is ill, a member of the family is sent to a nele (seer), who decides what the cause of the sickness is and what cure is needed. Through her or his ability to communicate with the spirits, the ‘seer’ is able to determine what the patient’s problem is. If the cure involves actual medicine, this medicine must be acquired from an inatulet (medicinal specialist), who also serves as a diagnostician in the absence of a ‘seer.’ The ‘medicinal specialist’ gathers plants of medicinal value from the nearby jungle. Before giving these plants to the patient’s family, he counsels them in order to activate them and give them life; that is, he transforms the plants into usable medicine. This activation process is carried out by directly addressing the spirits of the plants and telling them what they need to know in order to carry out their work.
In addition to the administration of physical medicine, curing, especially of serious diseases, often involves the performance of appropriate ikarkana. An ikar is performed by an ‘ ikar knower’ for the benefit of the sick person but addressed directly to the spirit world, in the form of a box of suar nuchukana (stick dolls), the representatives of the spirits of good, whose role it is to counter the evil spirits causing the disease. The sick person lies in a hammock in his or her house, and the ‘ ikar knower’ sits alongside on a bench. Under the hammock is the box of ‘stick dolls,’ as well as a pot of burning hot peppers and burning hot cacao, also used to fight off disease.
The ‘ ikar knower’ makes no physical gestures during the performance. He stares vaguely into space and, from time to time, smokes tobacco in his pipe. Others in the house either go about their usual business or sit beside the sick person and the ‘ ikar knower.’ The ‘ ikar knower’ performs the long (typically one hour or more) ikar in the late afternoon or early evening, after he has finished his other work for the day; he then leaves the house of the patient. He carries his walking stick and wears beads, signs of his role, and sometimes a tie. Performance of a curing ikar is usually repeated on four successive days.

Intimately related to the curing and prevention of disease is ina uanaet (medicine counsel), a set of ikarkana used to advise and counsel various types of medicine in order to activate them and render them effective. Certain objects in nature—for example, plants in the nearby mainland jungle—are inherently of medicinal value. 2 Nonetheless, in order to be effective, to be given life, these potential medicines must be told how to carry out their cure. This is precisely what occurs in ‘medicine counsel’ when the ‘medicinal specialist’ addresses the spirits of these plants directly. ‘Medicine counsel’ is performed in the jungle, at the moment of the cutting of the particular plant, and/or later on, in the home of the ‘medicinal specialist.’ The ‘medicinal specialist’ either sits or stands, with the medicine he is addressing placed directly in front of him. In addition to plants, such objects as pieces of glass, sticks, stones, phonograph needles, old shoes, or bars of soap can become medicinally effective if counseled. So while medicine is effective because of a combination of internal medicinal properties and power rendered through language, it is the verbal ‘counsel’ which is ultimately supreme, since without it nothing is effective and with it anything can become effective.
‘Medicine counsels’ are performed frequently and relatively publicly. They are typically performed by the ‘medicinal specialist’ when he returns from his morning’s work in the jungle. Many men have some knowledge of traditional medicine so that, even when they go to the jungle primarily for the purpose of farming or cutting wood, they often bring some medicine back with them. As a result, if you wander through a Kuna village at midday, through the bamboo walls of many houses you will hear the voices of men performing ‘medicine counsel’ to their just gathered medicine. These voices are often mingled with other voices and noises—the preparation of midday meals, children playing after their morning session at school, ordinary conversations, and radios.
There are various ‘medicine counsels,’ depending on what the medicine is to be used for and where it comes from. Muu ina uanaet (birth medicine counsel) advises medicine used in childbirth. Ina pukkip ikar (the way of much medicine), performed in the home of a sick person, counsels all the medicine in the jungle to come to the patient’s aid. Ina ulukanki (medicine in the trunks) counsels a whole medicinal laboratory; it is performed either in the home of the ‘medicinal specialist,’ in front of his collection of medicine, or in the home of a sick person. Ina tiikinet ikar (the way of the medicine in the water) counsels the medicine located at the bottom of a river.

A good example of variation and especially adaptation which functions to maintain tradition within the Kuna curing system is ‘medicine counsel.’ This set of ikarkana is used not only for traditional Kuna medicine but for any object or substance which is to be used as medicine. It is the ‘medicine counsel’ which renders the medicinal potential inherent in an object effective and gives it life, by explaining to it how to go about its work. This openness with regard to the class of medicine and its relationship to ‘medicine counsels’ makes it possible to accept and welcome non-Kuna, western medicine. From the Kuna point of view, it is quite possible for there to be medicine other than the plants that ‘medicinal specialists’ gather in the [Page 137] jungle; many objects are potentially medicinal. The skill of the ‘medicinal specialist’ consists not only in knowing what plants have medicinal value but in being able to counsel them and thus empower them. Similarly, the ikarkana used in the curing of disease are not in opposition to the medicine which is also used in the cure—they are complementary. The ikar advises the spirits of good to struggle against the spirits of evil. The ikar and the medicine work together. The more the patients have going for them, the better. So a cure can be effective by using Kuna medicine, Kuna ikarkana, and non-Kuna medicine, all at the same time. This is something which the Kuna understand perfectly well but outsiders have trouble grasping.

“The belief that individuals who repeatedly dream of the other sex are possessed and that tulekunedi, who appear with murderous intent in the dreams of others, should be killed by poisoning, clubbing, or burning (109) are undoubtedly aboriginal and perhaps are the same that Oviedo and Andagoya were describing when they wrote of persons possessed by an evil spirit. Though there are several accounts of such killings for the present century, the practice is now virtually discontinued. The discontinuance arises from a desire to be ‘civilized’; and replacing the killings are medicine cures recently developed by Chief Nele and other leading practitioners. Thus two Mandinga girls who several years ago repeatedly dreamed of meeting young men and whom the other villagers believed possessed and likely to bring danger to the whole community were successfully cured with medicines. On the other hand, the second chief at Rio Sidra early in 1940 convinced the inhabitants of his village that a man there was having dreams that were the result of possession and that unless he were killed the entire village was in danger. Consequently the man was burned to death, but the people of neighboring islands did not approve and for a time would have no traffic with the inhabitants of Rio Sidra.”

Among the after-the-fact explanations one finds statements such as, “the patient is suffering from soul loss, his soul presently residing in the Owner of the Cave's soul pool.” [Page 119] Or, “the man is suffering from malaria which he got in hot country the last time he went to the fincas.” Or, “the man's spirit is being eaten by a witch, Mr. X, who is angry with him because he did not pay back the money he owed.” Every after-the-fact description of antecedent conditions implies a cause and effect relation such that the cause can be manipulated so as the patient will recover from the illness. After-the-fact descriptions of the sources of disease processes are never final since they are always dependent on (a) the further development of the disease process in the patient and (b) the confirmation in the identification of the source of illness by a successful attempt to reduce the effect of the source. If manipulation of the hypothesized source reduces the illness, the diagnosis of source is concluded to be correct; if not, further source potentials are searched for.
There is relatively little explicit procedural apparatus for adding to the inventory of after-the-fact explanations, and there are relatively few devices for modifying the modes of identification of the cause of the disease process. If a change capability is built into this theory of illness in Aguacatenango, it is not easy to detect wherein it lies.
The modes of change that we have observed in Aguacatenangueros' response to illness have involved shifts from known medical practitioners to others, where the theory remains relatively unexplicated and the results of the medical practitioner's progress are used to judge the probability of opting some particular medical practitioner for a cure rather than some other. Response to illness involves the principle of exhaustion of resources. In severe illness, the family of the patient may exhaust all known medical practitioners who are thought to have sufficient knowledge and skill and also may exhaust all means for motivating curers to come and perform the cure. With the diminution of resources and exhaustion of the most proper curers, the family of the patient explores curing sources whose potential for curing may be lower, but still appreciable. Successful curing under such circumstances raises the probability that this family will use some newly successful medical practitioner sooner in the next onset of illness, that is, he will be called upon before they have exhausted their resources. The introduction of INI medical practice into Aguacatenango has been in these terms, namely, that patients and their families have turned to INI medical personnel upon the exhaustion of their resources. INI procedures have maintained a ratio of successes over failures in these curing circumstances such that they have continued to be called upon, in some cases under less extreme conditions. The ratio of successes over failures has not been so great, however, that INI is seen to be a totally satisfactory replacement for the more well established practitioners. Furthermore, INI treats only a small proportion of the total range of “illnesses” that occur in the community. INI will increase the proportion of cases it treats as it modifies the Aguacatenangueros' perception of the success' failure ratio and as it increases the classes of illness that it deals with. It may be the case that INI has at present a maximal investment in time and resources in maintaining its present range and success proportion, so future severe changes may not be expected from them. There is, however, some generalization to other INI type of curers--namely, doctors in San Cristobal. The generalization here may increase the use of doctors over curers. There is the further possibility that curers are incorporating into their theories some of the simpler strategies used by doctors. This is done so crudely that it hardly involves change of beliefs at any detailed level, but rather involves a simple increase of the inventories of medicine by means of which the curer implements his theory.

Datura meteloides, Jimson weed, Jamestown weed.—This is another plant, though not of the ball cactus family, which makes a great impression on the mind of the Tarahumara. The well-known Datura, or Jimson weed, is greatly feared by the Indians, and they do not dare to touch the plant. Anyone who breaks it, or pulls it up, will go crazy and finally die! The plant is common in the upper river gorges and is often found in the caves where the Indians go to live in the winter. This presents a problem. However, most problems have their solution in Tarahumaraland, as elsewhere. The peyote shaman, armed as he is with the virtue of a plant stronger than Jimson, has the power to pull up these weeds and destroy them without ill effects. This is done with the usual peyote ceremonies, and hence creates another sphere of usefulness for the peyote specialist...
The Mexicans call it by its Aztec name, toloachi; and the Tarahumaras call it dekúba . The Tarahumaras’ belief that children will go crazy if they play with the plant has a reason behind it. If a child eats the seeds, the effect can easily be fatal. The plant is used medicinally “for its very strong spirit.” Leaves are applied to the forehead to alleviate headaches, but must be removed soon after they are put there or the patient “may go crazy.” The peyote shaman is the only one who can remove the live plants which grow in the dwelling caves

There are marked differences in some cases between the religious practitioner and the ordinary non-specialist in regard to their treatment of religious knowledge. This does not mean that there are two spheres of religious thought, the shaman’s and layman’s, but that the shaman can offer more elaborate and detailed descriptions or add so-called secret details to the same basic body of materials. This difference in treatment is illustrated in the accounts given by a shaman and by non-shamans of rusiwari, a dangerous object or entity which supposedly causes illness. A shaman from Norogachic gave the following account: [Page -110-]
....I know by dreams that this rusiwari is not of this day. It is very ancient, from the ancient days,...from the days of the first people on earth. Because of this, the rusiwari are very dangerous to people and animals. These rusiwari do not like people because they are another kind of folk, very ancient, and different, and it is necessary to kill these rusiwari.
The rusiwari have a chief, the greatest one who commands the other rusiwari like a gobernador. The shaman must kill the chief. When I kill the chief the others leave because they have no leader. They are like a pueblo of rusiwari. I could not count them there are so many....
Statements made by non-shamans concerning these rusiwari were varied and certainly not organized or explained in the above manner. While all agreed that a rusiwari was exceedingly dangerous and that it caused illness, there was no identification made with any ancient being. Most informants concentrated on its dangerous attributes, but as to its appearance there was no clear agreement. Some said that it was a smooth stone that scampered about in obscure corners of a room; others, that it flew about like a small bird, and still others, that it was a small carving in the form of an animal. All of them agreed, however, that the rusiwari was an agent of a sorcerer who used it against his enemies, and that it was highly mobile and visible only to the shaman, though it might be heard by anyone.

The Tarahumara believe that harm can be done in dreams not only by shamans, but by anyone. Therefore, the decline in numbers of skilled practitioners of sorcery does not mean that the belief in sorcery is no longer a factor in social behavior among the Tarahumara.
One of the most important concepts is that of sepawumera, the term for sorcery. In a literal sense, it means to ‘eat the heart.’ Since the heart is the seat of the soul, a threat to the heart is a direct and fatal one. The practice of sepawumera is directly linked to dreams, for it is through the medium of dreams that some types of sorcery are carried out. The soul is believed to leave the body in dreams and to wander about. Should the soul be prevented from reentering the body, the person will sicken and die. Whatever experiences happen to the animals or persons that appear in these dreams may be accepted as actual events. Should the dream event suggest violence, the person or animal damaged or wounded in the dream struggle is said to be ‘frightened.’ This ‘fright’ causes illness. Since the dream experience is given a high reality valuation, and since any person, thing, or animal may become implicated, there is in dreams a potential threat of aggression of which anyone, not just the trained practitioner, may be suspected. This point is of extreme importance for the understanding of certain conflict situations in interpersonal relations. Some dreams are projections of desired events, that is, wish fulfillments. Others are [Page 115] projections of dreaded events. The aggressions that are not permitted overt expression can rise to conscious levels in dreams. Since the dream experience can be treated as a very real occurrence, projected hostilities or fear of hostilities from others are given a form of reinforcement that can lead to conflict.
It is well known that some types of dreams are culturally patterned, that is, they are directly influenced by the cultural milieu in both form and content. In some cultures animals, plants, or spirits in animal guises converse with the dreamer, and confer power through suggested ritual; in others, the traveling motif such as the voyage over land masses or under the sea, is frequent; in still others, visits from deceased ancestors are received, and so on. It is necessary actually, to differentiate between these ‘stereotyped’ dreams which are repeated in most essential features by many members of the same group, and the equally stereotyped dreams which exploit certain key situations in the culture. Such dreams are induced (though unsought for) by the pressures of interpersonal relations. They are extremely valuable as guides to some of the tensions prevalent in the society. The first kind of stereotyped dream can be exploited by trained individuals for specific purposes. An example is the shaman who works through such dreams. The second type is not controlled by the dreamer, but occurs to him [Page 116] unbidden and serves the dreamer only as an unconscious mechanism of release from tension. Not only the anxieties caused by interpersonal relations, but also those fears that arise from the uncertainties of weather, which affect his animals and crops, are given expression. Drought, hail, insects and disease are a constant threat...
In other such dreams the shaman talks to the souls of sick men and coaxes them to return to their bodies. He talks to the souls of oxen in order to make them work better. In dreams he discovers the location of lost objects.
The stereotyped dream of impending disaster is a common theme. An example of this is the dream of Juan Capochi from Choguita who dreamed that everyone in the pueblo was going to die of disease. [Page 117] He immediately notified the gobernador who, aware of the implications of such a dream, called all the people together and ordered them to make a fiesta, to kill two white oxen, and to dance the dutuburi . This type of dream involves the appearance of God and his verbal requests for a fiesta. Some disaster dreams involve such calamities as floods which wash away the pueblo, drowning everyone; or vast conflagrations caused by the sun descending close to the earth. In the rainy season, dreams of terrible hail storms that destroy all the crops occur.
The type of dream that is most directly indicative of strained interpersonal relations is recognized by the Tarahumara as a sorcery dream. When a Tarahumara has a dream that disturbs him so that he wakes with a feeling of anxiety, he calls the dream sepawumera. Some dreams supposedly directly implicate sorcerers (specialists). To dream of a rattlesnake is interpreted as an attempt upon che’s life by a sorcerer who tries to induce ‘fright.’ Dreams of rainbows and falling stars fall into this category. But the sort of dream that is most indicative of interpersonal tension is more situational in content rather than dependent upon such obvious symbols as a snake or falling star. Dreams of adultery on the part of one’s spouse, of being chased by a rival or enemy who has a knife or ax in hand, and dreams of desperate brawls fall into this class. It is believed [Page 118] that one is so frightened by these dreams that sickness results. Such sickness is then attributed to sorcery.

The Tarahumara consider illnesses to be of two types: those that afflict people's bodies and those that afflict their souls. The former usually are cured with plant or commercial medicines and increasingly are treated by physicians in Mexican government or Catholic facilities; the latter, which are usually produced by spirits, deities, or sorcerers, require the intervention of curing specialists who rely on their dreams to discover the causes of illness.

Three important categories of human beings also are omitted from the speeches. The first of these is sorcerers ( sukurúame ). 21 The Rarámuri of Rejogochi assume that both Indians and non-Indians and both men and women can become sorcerers, but they maintain that the majority of sorcerers as well as the most dangerous ones are Rarámuri men. These evil practitioners harm people in a number of ways. They (or rather their souls) travel during dreaming to capture the souls of their victims or they petition the Devil in their dreams to make their enemies sick. Sorcerers also dispatch the predatory animals they own—usually one of the evil birds called oromá, which are identified with shooting stars—to attack their victims. Once captured, the souls are held prisoner for a few days and then boiled and eaten by the sorcerers, often joined by their animal familiars and the Devil. When a soul is taken, the victim immediately becomes seriously ill and will die if a doctor cannot rescue the soul before it is destroyed. Children live only a day or so after their souls are stolen because they are not as “tough” ( biwárame ) as those of adults.
21 The term sukurúame is employed as both an adjective and a noun to convey several distinct meanings of differing specificity. Most generally, it means “strange, unusual, unfamiliar, foreign, or mysterious” and can describe anything or anyone that appears out of the ordinary. More specifically, it describes individuals and objects capable of influencing the behavior or well-being of others by means that are not generally available and therefore are mysterious. Included here are “magical” stones as well as people who possess special knowledge acquired from God or the Devil that allows them to cause or alleviate illnesses. Catholic priests sometimes are described as sukurúame in this sense because the Rarámuri assume that their relation with God is particularly close. Most specifically, sukurúame designates sorcerers and contrasts with several terms the Rarámuri use for “doctor”: rimérike (possibly from Spanish remedio, “remedy”), rotóri (from Spanish doctor ), and owirúame, “one who cures.” It also is applied to the animals and objects that sorcerers employ in their sorcery. In this sense, sukurúame has clearly evil connotations.

In the ensuing weeks, Calistro continued to lose weight and to talk, cry, and breathe heavily in his sleep. His in-laws were worried about his condition and puzzled by the failure of the bakánawi specialist’s cure. They asked Calistro about his past, trying to find something he might have done that would have led to his present state. They learned that when he was a small child, a peyote ceremony had been held at his parents’ home. Just after the ceremony ended, Calistro started playing on the patio where the performance had been staged and consequently, his in-laws reasoned, had come in contact with peyote.

God is usually benevolent to the Rarámuri because they are his children, but as with bakánawi and híkuri, their relationship with God is based ultimately on balanced reciprocity. The people repay God for his care and encourage his continued benevolence by offering him food in fiestas and acting in conformance with his teachings. If people fail to maintain the balance or to act properly, God will withdraw his care, thus giving the Devil free rein to harm them. If he is extremely displeased, he will ask the Devil to send illnesses, a request with which the Devil readily complies. God also can work harm more directly. For example, if people whom God has blessed with prolific herds refuse to return a portion of these animals to him by sacrificing them during fiestas, God will take the souls of these animals himself and may further punish the misers by reclaiming their souls or those of one or more of their children. The bakánawi specialist, it will be remembered, thought such an offense had caused Calistro’s illness. If parents neglect or are unduly harsh with their children, God will call the souls of the children back to heaven where he and his wife can care for them, thereby causing the parents anguish and sorrow. Also, the Rarámuri suspect that a slow and painful death is God’s punishment for crimes such as thievery or sorcery.

Calistro never gave much credence to the diagnosis implicating peyote, perhaps because this diagnosis implied that he participated, albeit unwittingly, in causing his illness. Instead, he suspected the outright malevolence of two of his neighbors, who he believed had bewitched him. Calistro’s symptoms were consistent with a diagnosis of sorcery because, like bakánawi and peyote, sorcerers are thought to tie up people’s extremities as well as steal their souls. Such attacks often are felt to occur when the victim has offended the sorcerer, but sometimes evil sorcerers will harm someone simply because they are malevolent. Calistro characterized his assumed assailants in this light, reinforcing this image by claiming that they directed their evil toward his defenseless child as well as toward him. To recover from sorcery, the victims must convince Rarámuri doctors to confront the sorcerers and force them to undo their evil. I never heard that Calistro engaged a doctor for this purpose, but such arrangements usually remain secret.
Calistro’s adherence to diagnoses in which he was not held directly responsible for his illness contrast with those proposed by his in-laws and doctors. In the early stages of the illness, these people concurred on diagnoses in which Calistro was not personally responsible for his misfortune. As the disease worsened, however, they increasingly placed the blame on him. By the end, they assumed that he was suffering from a venereal disease deriving ultimately if not directly from Chabochis.
The point of transition in the progression of the diagnosis came at the second appearance of the bakánawi specialist. By performing the first bakánawi ceremony for Calistro, the doctor acknowledged bakánawi ’s role in the ailment. He agreed to perform the second ceremony unaware of the extent of Calistro’s decline in the intervening six months. When he saw the severity of Calistro’s condition, he immediately shifted the responsibility from bakánawi, over whom he proclaimed some control, to God and ultimately to Calistro for his failure to fulfill his obligations to God. Since lingering illness is usually interpreted as God’s punishment, such a conclusion was accepted as reasonable by everyone but Calistro.
Calistro’s family, neighbors, and doctors were not trying to hurt Calistro by blaming him for his ailment. They were desperate to find a cure and assumed that such a terrible illness must have been punishment for something he had done. Severe illnesses tend to be diagnosed as caused by beings who are angry with the patient. Such diagnoses always imply that the sick person is at least partly responsible, so suggesting that Calistro had done something to bring on his illness was not unusual. What was unusual was Calistro’s refusal to accept responsibility. Most patients willingly admit their shortcomings because they can be cured only if the cause of their illness can be determined. Calistro did not do so, I think, because he had not committed adultery and truly believed he had not done the other things the diagnoses implied, like offending peyote or God. Yet he did not resist the treatments arranged for him by his wife’s parents even when these treatments were motivated by diagnoses with which he did not agree. He accepted these treatments because the other measures taken to alleviate his illness had failed. As his health declined, he also became increasingly resigned to the possibility of his death and willing to place his fate in the hands of others.

Serious illness was ascribed to personalized causes: retaliation from offended spirit beings or by sorcery for improper behavior or for having done wrong to another party, animal or human. Curing could involve a specialist's use of medicinal plant remedies, the sweat lodge, the Midewiwin ceremony, and a shaman's aid in soliciting the victim's confession of past taboo breaches or other acts that might have brought about the ailment (Hallowell 1992: 92-96).

The tanning of hides (chiefly those of the deer) was the work of the women and was done in an expert manner, the hides being soft and colored a golden brown. An old woman said, “rabbit skin was a great help to the Indians.” She said that the women hung the hides on bushes for several days and part of the soft fur was blown away by the wind, but the “firmer” hair remained. Hides prepared in this way were used inside a cradle board and inside children's moccasins; they were also used in the making of children's caps. Rabbit skins were sewed together in patches to make blankets. The Mississippi Chippewa did not make woven rabbit-skin blankets like those used by the northern divisions of the tribe.

It is useless to withhold anything, because the doctor, with the aid of his other-than-human helpers, will probably find out what kind of bad conduct has followed me. Consequently, the discovery and articulation of it become equivalent to a confession of wrongdoing. [Page 413] This is an essential step, necessary to promote recovery. 19 Medicine can then do its work. Thus, confession adds considerable psychological force to the disease sanction. In order to get well, the individual has to suffer not only guilt, but the shame of exposure involved in confession—although this may relieve some of his anxiety.
19 Dunning points out that medicine men “were experts in the mytho-theological field of knowledge, who exploited and manipulated the situation on the basis of vision-acquired power … the basis of their authority lay in the general belief in retributive justice. If a man transgressed the mores of his society and did not become ill or die, he felt lucky and might tempt fate again by a repetition of the deed. Should he become ill, this would be clear evidence for himself and everyone that he had done wrong, and the social norms would be thus reinforced by his example. It was the duty of the medical specialist to probe the wrong behavior of the patient. And by public confession, not only did the patient recover from his illness, but the social norms of the society were upheld” (16, pp. 180–81).

Jenness, Diamond. 1935. “The Ojibwa Indians of Parry Island, Their Social and Religious Life.” In Bulletin, vi, 115. Ottawa: National Museum of Canada, J. O. Patenaude, printer.

--p
The Parry Island Ojibwa distinguish three kinds of medicine-men, who differed greatly in their methods. They were:
(1) Wabeno: the healer and charm-maker;
(2) Djiskiu: the conjuror;
(3) Kusabindugeyu: the seer.
These three professions were mutually exclusive, so that no individual could ever become both a djiskiu and a kusabindugeyu, or a kusabindugeyu and a wabeno. Although each practitioner received a special “call” in a vision at adolescence, he might not practise until he reached maturity. Even then, the Indians say, he could not use his powers continuously, but only about once a month. For the medicine-man exhausted himself physically and mentally whenever he practised his art; too frequent exertion overstrained his powers, antagonized the supernatural being who had granted him his blessing, and brought about his death. Once a month, however, the moon, which renews the mysterious power in women, likewise renewed the medicine-man's power, so that he could safely peer into the future or effect one cure every four weeks.
Certain natives gave a slightly different explanation of the reason why a medicine-man could perform only at infrequent intervals. Each day in the year, they claimed, was controlled by a special manido, and since the medicine-man's powers were derived from and controlled by one of those supernatural beings, he could employ them only on the day or days his manido was functioning. This was partly the reason, they asserted, why the adolescent boy fasted one or two days the first month, two or three days the second, three or four days the third; for by this progression he would finally light on a day whose manido would consent to bless him. It explained, also, why no one ever thought of urging a medicine-man to practise his art on any particular day. If a woman had lost some treasured [Page 61] possession, the chief of the band might summon a meeting of all the medicine-men; but instead of selecting one special man to discover the lost article he passed a pipe around and asked, “Is there any one here who can help the woman?” On certain days the pipe circulated around unsmoked, because each medicine-man knew that his powers were for the time being inoperative. Only the man whose manido happened to be functioning on that day would venture to smoke the pipe and volunteer his services.
Many Indians acquired a reputation for great skill in the cure of diseases by the use of herbal remedies. They were known as mashkikike-wanini: “medicine-workmen or herbalists”; but in the eyes of their fellow-tribesmen they were not true medicine-men because they derived their powers from a purely human knowledge of the effects of various plants, not from a vision and blessing conferred by the supernatural world. For the same reason the majority of the Parry Islanders do not regard as genuine medicine-men the members ( medé) of the Midewiwin or Grand Medicine Society. 1 This society never succeeded in establishing itself on the island, at least within the memory of its present inhabitants; but the natives know of its existence in other bands, and that it numbers two ex-members even among themselves. They believe that wherever it exists most medicine-men join it in order to use their knowledge and powers as medé during the intervals when their true medicine-powers are quiescent, because it enables a djiskiu or a kusabindugeyu to prescribe herbal remedies for which his real profession gives him no authority. As currently used on Parry island, however, the term medé carries an evil connotation, and is practically synonymous with sorcerer or witch.
From a natural magnification of things distant and unknown, the Parry Islanders entertain considerable awe of foreign medicine-men. Some of them who know of the Blackfoot and Assiniboine tribes to the westward assert that the shadow ( udjibbom) of every Blackfoot keeps guard over his kinsmen, so that however scattered a family may be, each member enjoys the protection of all the rest. The Assiniboine ( Sin-e-buan: “stone medicine-men”) are even more dangerous. Originally they were a group of medicine-men so powerful that they separated off from other people and became a distinct tribe. Today their medicine-men, buan, who use a water-drum ( buankik) like the members of the Grand Medicine Society, are more powerful than any other; they can read a man's thoughts at a single glance, and hear the cry of a drowning friend and save him even though he may be 100 miles away. But no one can become a buan except through the help of the Sinebuan or Assiniboine, who first kill him, then restore him to life again.
“My foster-father's brother, Buankins, once went west, encountered the Sinebuan and became a buan. He could sense the needs of strangers the moment he entered their camp. People used to visit him continually to ask his advice in sickness. He did not undertake to cure them, but advised them to gather some herb or other and use it” (Pegahmagabow).
If we exclude the medé, however, only the three classes of medicine-men previously mentioned played any important rôle in the lives of the Parry Island Ojibwa.

WABENO
The word wabeno comes from waban: “the twilight that precedes the dawn”; but the Indians interpreted it in two different ways. One man thought that it signified “daylight comes,” and referred to the strength of a man in the early morning. Another translated it as “eastern man,” because a wabeno walks sunwise (i.e. clockwise) round a plant until he stands on its western side, facing the eastern sky, before he plucks the leaf or root he requires to make his medicine. Legend states that the first wabeno, Bidabbans: “Day-dawn,” received his power from the moon.
“Day-dawn's child died, and the father wept aloud for it. Moon said to him, ‘Do not weep, for your child shall come to life again. Call together ten men and ten women.’ He called the ten men and the ten women. Moon then gave him a drum, and inspired him with a song; and as he drummed and sang the ten men and the ten women danced. Day-dawn raised his head and looked at them. Behold, his dead child was alive again and dancing with them. ‘This is the blessing I have bestowed on you,’ said Moon. ‘Hereafter you shall heal the sick. Had you not wept for your child, mankind would always return to life.’ Day-dawn regretted his error, but it was too late; man cannot now return from the grave. Nevertheless, the people brought a sick man to Day-dawn and he healed him” (Jim Nanibush).
The wabeno was a healer of diseases, and a maker of love and hunting medicines. Like the herbalist and the medé, he specialized in plant medicines; but he had greater power and knowledge than these two classes of practitioners, because he had received a direct blessing (“diploma”) from some supernatural being during his boyhood fast. The earliest wabenos are reported to have learned the properties of the various plants from dreams. This source then became practically closed; but the old knowledge was handed down from generation to generation, and youths aspiring to be wabenos apprenticed themselves to established practitioners, who for payment would impart their secrets. Yet no one might offer himself as a candidate who had not first received the supernatural sanction during his period of fast; for the wabeno's real power was deemed to reside less in the plants themselves than in the added virtues they acquired through his association with a manido.
There was nothing formal about the apprenticeship. The novice merely visited his teacher from time to time and learned whatever the older man was willing to impart. He might purchase knowledge from a number of practitioners, as opportunities arose, until his final pharmacopia became a medley from several sources. With the outward technique of the profession he was already familiar from childhood; for it was a common pastime of the children to drum and dance and sing wabeno songs in imitation of the real medicine-men. Nevertheless, he could not “graduate” and set himself up in practice until he had given a public exhibition of his supernatural powers at a feast and dance held in conjunction with other wabenos.
The wabeno was a highly honoured public official, in a sense, for he was the servant of his community, even though he was entitled to charge a fee for his services. Since his prestige depended partly on his popularity he generally gave a public feast and dance whenever a patient paid for the remedy that dispelled his sickness, or a hunter offered fitting compensation for the medicine that had delivered the game into his hands. These feasts and dances, unlike those of the Grand Medicine Society, [Page 63] were open to every one, men, women, and children. They were held in any conveniently large wigwam, began and ended with feasting, and lasted, as a rule, throughout an entire night. The leading wabeno initiated the dancing by advancing into the centre of the wigwam and beating his tambourine, which differed in no way from a secular tambourine except that the deerskin membrane sometimes bore a painting of its owner's manido. The people fell into line behind him, and danced and sang around the central fire. When the first wabeno ceased drumming and resumed his seat another stepped forward and led the throng. At intervals in the dances one of the medicine-men might drum and dance alone around the fire, then, stooping, pick up from the embers a hot stone; or he might dip his fingers into a boiling cauldron, extract a piece of meat, and swallow it without evidence of pain. Some Indians say that he derived these powers from the medicines he rubbed on his hands, and that although he neither ate nor drank for four days and four nights previously, his strength remained totally unimpaired.
“I have seen a wabeno swallow a knife that was a foot long. Only the handle protruded from his mouth. He walked around the fire four times that all who were present might see him, then slowly withdrew the knife” (James Walker)
“A wabeno knows instinctively, as it were, if his son has received a visit and blessing from a manido. He checks the lad from playing with other children, and makes him remain quietly at home or in a separate hut” (Pegahmagabow).
The true medicine-man, whether wabeno, kusabindugeyu, or djiskiu, always used his power to help his fellow-men, and, consequently, one of his principal duties was to foil the machinations of sorcerers. The wabeno had reputedly more power than the members of the other two professions, more power, too, than any sorcerer or medé. Now a sorcerer often sought to compass the death of his enemy by magically shooting into his body a piece of bone, splinter of wood, or other object that only a medicine-man could discover and remove. When a man fell ill from this cause the wabeno diagnosed the seat of the malady and laid over it a piece of birch bark, or a leaf smeared with one of his composite herbal remedies. After drumming and singing he drew away the leaf, drawing away at the same time the stick or bone that caused the infection. At times he might even attack the sorcerer himself, “shooting” him with sickness just as the sorcerer shot his victims.
“Once a wabeno and a medé held a contest to see who was the more powerful. They built their wigwams a few yards apart, and each man sat inside his lodge with the contents of his medicine-bag spread out in front of him. The medé had a large bag full of many medicines, the wabeno a small bag containing only a few. They sat and shot at one another. The magic feather, stick, or other missile sped through the air unseen and struck its victim in the chest; but the wounded man simply rubbed his body with medicine and extracted it. Thus they fought all through the day, shooting at each other alternately, until at last the wameno had but one medicine left. He called to the medé, ‘I have but one medicine left; if that fails you will kill me.’ It was a pinch of sand about the size of an ordinary charge of powder. He shot, and the sand penetrated into every part of the medé's body, rendering the counter-medicine useless. The man's body and limbs swelled up until he died. Thus the wabeno proved his superiority” (Jonas King).

KUSABINDUGEYU
The kusabindugeyu 1 were primarily seers, gifted by their adolescent visions to discern what was normally hidden from human eyes. Most [Page 64] of them claimed to derive their power from thunder, but during the winter months, when thunder had retreated far to the southward (thunderstorms are exceedingly rare in Parry Sound during the winter) they summoned other manidos to aid them in their rites, principally perhaps a small owl ( kokoko) and the whip-poor-will ( waholi). Instead of a tambourine, they 1 used a disk-like rattle ( shishigwan) of parchment 6 to 9 inches in diameter, handleless, but with a loose flap of skin pierced with a hole for suspension. This instrument, and some hollow bone tubes, formed their entire stock-in-trade; for, unlike the wabeno, the kusabindugeyu never employed herbal remedies in his profession, although he might use them as a layman, or if he happened to be a member of the Grand Medicine Society.
The kusabindugeyu claimed to pry into the future, to behold what was far away, and to discern what was hidden inside a man's body. Others might dream about these things, but the real seer professed to behold them with his own eyes even in broad daylight. Some Parry Islanders believe that he could discover the secret thoughts of distant people and evoke an enemy's shadow ( udjibbom), causing insanity and perhaps death; but that he never used this power to the detriment of his own people. His procedure was simple in the extreme. Kneeling on the ground he sang his medicine-song and shook his rattle. A manido entered it with a dull thud audible to all around; sometimes three or four manidos, if he continued to shake the rattle. They gave no other sign of their presence, but merely opened the seer's eyes so that he might behold the object of his quest.
“In my boyhood I had a swelling on the neck which emitted much pus when lanced. My mother called in an old blind kusabindugeyu to discover whether I would die. He said to her ‘I will tell you to-morrow.’ On the morrow he came again and said ‘Your boy will recover when the snow lies half an inch thick on the ground. He will not die, for I have seen him living far down the years.’ The seer spoke truly. The swelling disappeared in the early winter and I am now an old man” (James Walker).
Hollow bone tubes made from bird's leg-bones formed part of the kusabindugeyu's equipment and took the place of the wabeno's remedies. By means of his rattle the seer first sought the stick or other object implanted in the sick man's body. If the case were hopeless and death impending the rattle emitted a strange smell; but if the object became visible it was possible for the medicine-man to extract it with his tubes. He swallowed from one to six of them, allowing the last one to protrude slightly from his mouth. Through this he sucked against the infected spot, drew out the object, and vomited all the tubes at once into a basin of clean water. No one might speak or make a noise while the operation lasted lest a sudden sound should cause the medicine-man to choke and kill himself.
“My brother once suffered from a constant pain between the shoulders, and my mother sent me to bring a kusabindugeyu. The seer came, and after drinking some whisky and smoking his pipe, laid his rattle on the ground beside the fire. There it emitted two loud cracks as a manido entered it. He took it up again, and danced and sang around the fire. Then he drew out two bone tubes, one much longer than the other, and swallowed them; but the short tube protruded a little from his mouth. [Page 65] Kneeling beside my brother he sucked violently with this short tube against the skin between the shoulders. Suddenly he vomited both tubes into a basin of clean water my mother had set beside him. ‘Look,’ he exclaimed, as he held up the bowl and carried it round for us to examine. Floating on the water with the bones was something that looked like a tiny feather about half an inch long, at one end of which was a minute black speck. ‘That black speck,’ the medicine-man said, ‘would grow and grow inside the boy's body until it killed him.’ He removed his tubes and drank all the water, swallowing the feather with it. My brother recovered very quickly. Not long afterwards this same kusabindugeyu healed another sick man by sucking out of his body, with the longer of his two tubes, a quantity of yellow bile” (James Walker).
Occasionally a sorcerer produced sickness not by implanting an object in the body of his victim, but by stealing away his soul. A medicine-man might discover where it was hidden and restore it. If he failed, and the sick man was an important member of the community, relatives sometimes engaged two or three kusabindugeyu to sacrifice a white dog. They bound the animal, laid it on top of a pile of sticks, and stunned it with a club (or in some cases, the Indians thought, rendered it unconscious with a drug). Then they set fire to the pile, and, kneeling in front of it, tried to discern the location of the missing soul. Any wriggling or howling of the dog was an evil omen that rendered their efforts vain. The Parry Islanders claim that this dog-sacrifice was a very ancient custom of their people, although resorted to only in grave emergencies.
“In early times the skies were always cloudless, but heavy fogs at night often caused the dew to drip from the wigwams. The first cloud arose in the east just before the coming of white men. The Indians did not understand the warning, so they sacrified a white dog, and six kusabindugeyu knelt with their faces to the ground, three on one side of the pyre and three on the other. Thus they discovered what the clouds signified. Since that day the skies have been often clouded and thunderstorms frequent” (Pegahmagabow).

DJISKIU	
The Djiskiu, or, as he was more rarely called, Djasakid, ranked as high or higher than the kusabindugeyu, 1 but employed a totally different method for diagnosing the causes of sickness and for discovering things lost or far away. He used neither a drum nor a rattle, but conjured up his helping spirits inside a cylindrical lodge that was especially built for the purpose and afterwards dismantled. We may, therefore, call him a conjuror, as contrasted with the seer, kusabindugeyu, who laid claim to second sight, and the wabeno, who restricted himself almost exclusively to herbal medicines.
The conjuror, like the other two classes of medicine-men, derived his power from a vision at puberty, when a manido visited him and conferred upon him the special gift of divining by means of the conjuring lodge. Most conjurors claimed thunder as their manido, because thunder was credited with granting the greatest power. They underwent no training subsequent to their visions, but could not practise until they reached manhood; for although the manido's blessing gave them the requisite supernatural power, they needed full strength of mind and body to make use of it. Only men in the prime of life could conjure, and then not more often [Page 66] than once a month, or perhaps two or three times in a summer; the ordeal was too exhausting, or, as the Indians say, the helping spirits disturbed too greatly the medicine-man's soul. Hence a great many conjurors were also medé, able to prescribe herbal remedies every day in the year, even in old age when their conjuring powers were extinguished.
The djiskan, or conjuring lodge, consisted of six or eight poles arranged in a circle to enclose a space about 4 feet in diameter. A hoop encircled them near the top, partly to hold the frame together, partly to provide a seat for the helping spirits. Four deer dew-claws attached to one of the poles rattled whenever the lodge was shaken, and rolls of birch bark, or in recent times cloth, enveloped the entire frame to a height of about 6 feet.
It was not the conjuror who erected this lodge, but the people who requisitioned his services. On rare occasions they set up two lodges within a few feet so that the medicine-man might place his coat inside one and himself enter the other; both lodges then shook during his séance. The Indians claim that an exceptionally powerful conjuror could mark off the space for a lodge by creating a hollow in the ground 3 feet deep with a single sweep of his hand, and that a second wave of his hand at the conclusion of his séance restored the ground to its original position.
Let us imagine ourselves now in an Indian camp, sharing all the views of the Parry Islanders as to what takes place during a conjuror's séance. Some man has hired him to discover why a relative lies dangerously ill, and, with the assistance of friends, has erected a proper conjuring lodge.
We idle around until dusk, for, unlike the kusabindugeyu, the conjuror may not operate in full daylight. At last he approaches, crawls beneath the birch-bark envelope and disappears within. He is speaking. We cannot distinguish the words, but we know he is calling the manido that blessed him during his puberty fast, and the other manidos that always lend their aid. There is a sudden thud, and the lodge rocks violently, for a spirit ( medewadji: a spirit of the conjuring lodge) has entered it. Another thud and further rocking; then another, and still another. Perhaps a voice says “What do you want me for?,” and snapping turtle ( mashikkan) answers: “We do not want your help.” Inside the lodge there are now five or six medewadji or manidos, souls or spirits of animals like the bear and the serpent, who have assembled together with the spirit of thunder, their chief, and of snapping turtle, longest-lived of all creatures, their interpreter. We cannot see them, but we understand that turtle rests at the bottom of the lodge, feet up, keeping it from sinking into the ground; that thunder is at the top, covering it like a lid; and that the other spirits are perched around the hoop that encircles the frame. 1 They look like human beings about 4 inches tall, but have long ears and squeaking voices like bats.
Meanwhile the conjuror has been kneeling on the floor of the lodge with his face to the ground, and remains thus (supposedly) throughout the performance. Probably he has omitted to take any tobacco inside with him, and since the manidos require a little tribute before they set about their task his employer must hand in some tobacco over the top [Page 67] of the lodge. A brief period of silence follows, and the faint aroma of tobacco smoke floats from the shrine. Then the manidos discuss among themselves the cause of the sick man's condition. They decide that a sorcerer has bewitched him, so with a violent rocking of the lodge one of them departs to summon the soul of the offender for trial.
The audience outside the lodge now becomes visibly excited, and the employer of the conjuror draws nearer. Again the lodge rocks as the manido brings in the sorcerer's soul. “Is it you who have caused my son's sickness?” shouts the employer. “Is it you?” The soul cannot avoid confessing if the sorcerer is guilty. “Shall we kill him? Shall we kill him?” shout the medewadji in their squeaky voices, while thunder closely guards the top of the lodge to prevent the soul's escape. “No, not yet,” replies the man, who is generally afraid of being held responsible for the sorcerer's death. “Let him restore my son to health and pay us fitting compensation. How much will be pay?” So the man outside and the soul within bargain with one another until they arrive at an agreement. Then the manidos release the soul, which returns to its owner; and the lodge rocks for the last time as they themselves depart. The séance has ended. The exhausted conjuror crawls out from his shelter and retires to his tent. Tomorrow, or the next day perhaps, the relatives of the sick man will pay him for his toil.
The performance just described explains the general character of these séances; but no two of them were exactly alike, not only because they were held for different needs, but because each conjuror had his special methods. On rare occasions he might even remain outside the lodge (presumably after concealing a confederate within). Sometimes, it is said, his medewadji or helping spirits cured sickness by exchanging the soul of the patient with that of a man in perfect health; the latter merely felt indisposed for a short time until his new soul regained strength. Or, again, when a band of Indians were starving, the helping spirits summoned and killed the shadow of a moose or deer; then the next day the hunters killed the animal itself, which no longer possessed a shadow to warn it of danger.
“I once helped to erect a djiskan so that a conjuror might discover why a certain child was ill. We heard the manidos say to one another inside the lodge ‘We cannot do anything. The child will have to die.’ The child died” (Jonas King). ...
Some of the Parry Islanders credit the conjurors, or individual members of the profession, with the most extraordinary powers, exceeding those of the kusabindugeyu and wabeno. They report that a conjuror has taken a man by the ankle and lifted him high in the air with one hand; has loosened himself, unaided, from a network of ropes that bound him; has destroyed, with the aid of thunder, evil serpents that preyed on the Indians' camps; and has even sent his helping spirits with a load of furs 60 miles to a trading post, whence they brought back several cases of whisky within an hour.
“Before there was a settlement at Parry sound, Bill King and two or three other Indians exhausted their supply of flour and bacon; but they had four marten skins. One of the Indians was a conjuror, so Bill and his companions erected a djiskan for him. They passed the four marten skins inside the lodge, and within a few minutes the conjuror produced in exchange for them a 50-pound sack of flour which his medewadji had brought from Penetanguishene 100 miles away” (Jonas King).
The Indians on Parry island today live in constant fear of witchcraft, to which they attribute many deaths, believing that it has greatly increased since conjurors disappeared from their midst. Formerly, they say, the conjuror could punish the sorcerer by summoning his soul into the djiskan, where one of the helping spirits, at the request of the dead man's relatives, would kill it with a sharpened stick of cedar. “Get out of my way. I'll kill it,” the spirits would cry as they vied with one another to execute their victim. Sorcerers whose souls thus perished immediately fell sick and died. Hence many of them wore as amulets ( wadjigan) small stones or pieces of bone resembling a human face, which protected their souls from the clutches of the spirits and allowed them to practise their witchcraft unpunished.
“When I was a young man living at Shawanaga a medewadji tried several nights in succession to carry away my soul. I am sure it was a conjuror who was trying to harm me, because my father and grandfather had offended some of the Indians on lake Huron, and these Indians destroyed by sorcery every member of their families except myself” (Pegahmagabow).
Not every conjuror, one Indian said, had the courage to permit his helping spirits to destroy a sorcerer's soul, even after he held it prisoner within his djiskan. The audience outside might feel that there were extenuating circumstances, that the man had perhaps acted in self-defence. Then the spirits would release the soul, and at some later time a court of medés and wabenos would retry the case. They built a fire of sticks and stationed the accused man beside it. If he were guilty the sticks changed into snakes and killed him.
Like the wabeno, the conjuror sometimes entertained his countrymen with a feast and dance, but the entertainment was purely secular and the dancers employed an ordinary drum.

Religious leaders were also limited in their use of power by the belief that overuse of talents led to disease in the specialist's family (Kidder 1918: 85–88). Some Ojibwas were ambitious enough to sacrifice the health of their families but for the most part this belief acted as a control on the search for religious powers. Most shamans ceased their activity rather than endanger their families.

False Faces and Husk Faces, as well as the musical instruments of the curing societies, are not deemed proper objects to accompany the dead, even though the person may have acquired these in the same manner as an eagle wand. ... if the deceased had been an herbal curer, all his or her “medicines” should be buried separately in the earth. They may be dug up again after the ten-day mourning period and used by another specialist, if he is sure of the proper usage. However, by far the safest course is to bury the medicine and leave it buried, because “it might be dangerous” after the rightful owner has died. Medicines are individualistic and dangerous, and might work only for the “doctor” who originally owned them and knew how to use them. But in this case, too, relatives are loath to discard a useful material, and some keep the medicines and merely purify them by smoking them with pine branches and the burnt root of skwa[unknown] eda (coltsfoot), after the tenth-day feast. Occasionally, an individual will express a wish to “take along” his favorite snow snake or walking stick, and such desires are granted. However, no informant at Six Nations could remember seeing any wampum in a coffin, as has been reported in the literature and is found in archeological excavations.

Whether the medicine is collected by an amateur or by a specialist, the techniques are identical. Spring and fall are the preferred seasons for the collection of plants; however, any time of the year is acceptable except “when the lightening bugs are out” (June and July), for it is thought that in midsummer the roots are hollow, thus reducing the strength of the preparations. Nevertheless, if a plant is needed during midsummer, it is procured and used, although an extra dosage is added in an attempt to achieve the usual strength. The collector should go out early in the day, and, to the first exemplar encountered of each desired species, he should give some Indian tobacco and respectfully inform it that a specimen is desired as a medicine for disease X for person Y. The tobacco which is offered to the plant is the most important tool of the herbalist, for it is the tobacco which transmits the message to the spirit force of the plant, thus permitting the individual specimens to be effective. The tobacco is also a reciprocal gift to the spirit force. In an emergency, herbalists use medicine collected without tobacco, but it is considered to be very weak indeed. The Indian name of the designee should be mentioned, but if the medicine is not intended for any particular person, the plant should be informed that the medicine is being collected for future use for “anyone at all.” Thereafter, any other specimens may be procured. However, should any untoward signs appear immediately before or during the collection of the plants--such as a snake crossing his path or the appearance of a hearse, an inebriated person, or a menstruating woman--the collector should either turn the other way or preferably refrain from collecting that day, since the medicine picked after such an incident is at best not of full strength and possibly even dangerous. Of course, a woman must never collect medicine during her menstrual period, for medicine is particularly prone to [Page 265] spoilage by any contact with a catamenial woman (see pp. 216-7 supra ). Due to the danger of damaging the medicine by an ominous encounter and also in part due to fear of being suspected of witchcraft, collectors usually pursue their tasks in secret. Once home they are quite willing to admit having collected plants in the morning, though there exists, particularly among the specialists, a certain reluctance to divulge the location of the plants and the ingredients of the medicines.

The fact that a person allows himself to be treated at the hospital does not indicate that he abandons a search for the cause of his disease, for the purely physiological explanations of the Ohsweken physician are not always persuasive. Longhouse members do talk in terms of “germs” and “high blood pressure,” and on that level they understand natural cause-and-effect relationships. However, they continue suspiciously to wonder why they, as particular individuals, are subjected to the disease. This is especially true if the disease is lingering and hard to cure, or if the hospital is unable to diagnose why the patient “feels bad.” Surely, there must then be something causing the disease which white man's medicine cannot understand and does not have the historical perspective to appreciate, and it is therefore necessary to find the true etiology of the disease (a typically “Indian” cause) and apply an “Indian” treatment. To determine the true etiology one has recourse to an Indian specialist, namely, the fortuneteller.

Boys may “pick up” the songs while they are young and help sing for years before having to join the society for one reason or another. Since active ritualists sing in many societies, the obligations which would be incumbent on them were they formally to “join” each one would be rather strenuous. Sometimes, however, an illness of a performer is attributed to his not being a member or not being “strong enough” to have contact with such powerful medicine. When this diagnosis is made, the performer usually joins the society in which he has been singing, and some singers do finally join a formidable number of societies. Perhaps the leniency with which the Six Nations medicine societies accept the participation of nonmembers is simply an indication of the scarcity of trained specialists (for fewer and fewer of the boys “pick up” the song cycles) and an instance of flexibility under difficult circumstances. Whatever the reason, the fact does show that the societies are not exclusive or “secret.”

The curing ceremony itself might call for the services of a shamanistic specialist. One such ritual was the awataerohi (J.R. 10:183; 13:31, 171; 13:187-189; 17:171; 21:151). The disease was named after the “demon” which imbedded itself in the body causing pain at a particular spot. This spirit was the size of a fist and could only be exorcised by dancing, juggling, and chewing hot coals and rubbing the body of the patient. The ability to handle these coals without getting burnt depended on powers received in a dream-vision. One man who had been this particular type of shaman related to the Jesuits how his twenty-year career began. When he first aspired to this type of shamanistic ability, he was unable to handle the coals without getting burnt. He was getting discouraged when one night he had a dream that [Page 64] he was performing the ceremony flawlessly and painlessly. What enabled him to do this was a song that he was singing which he had never heard before. He awoke and remembered the song. At the next occasion when such a ceremony was needed he was able to participate. As soon as he began to sing his song, he went into an ecstatic state and not only handled the hot coals, but put his arm in a boiling kettle without pain or physical harm. In the future he occasionally had dreams that he should wear a special garment while doing the ceremony, or a special ornament. He never failed to follow these “revelations” and therefore never lost his magico-religious power (J.R. 21:153). It must be noted that this power did not extend to other types of rituals, but that nevertheless he had been able to heal and help many people over his twenty years of doing the awataerohi. Sagard describes this ceremony and claims that it took place in a darkened hut.

The handles of spoons are frequently carved with designs which are ornamental, totemistic, or in response to dreams, particularly those occurring during some indisposition or illness. The dreams are interpreted by a local seer or medical practitioner, who decides upon the design, also the kind of wood, the presentation of such dream-objects to the patient being necessitated to secure recovery. Failure in this respect is believed to be followed by continued illness and eventually by death. The custom seems to have been based upon the belief that the soul can depart from the body and that satisfaction of its desires must be obtained to bring about its return.

The vocabulary naturally reflects the meteorological phenomena. These were often personified or believed to be controlled by beings and were thought to be affected by the actions of men, especially by breaches [Page [p.30-b]] of taboo. Not only were there almost professional weather forecasters whose expert advice was consulted before voyages were undertaken, but most persons were observant of weather signs to be read in the look of the mountains, and both shamans and laymen knew magic to control the weather.

Like other peoples, the Blackfoot Indians employed simple home remedies for minor ailments, but when someone was seriously ill they called upon a man or woman who had magic powers with which to cure the sick. The Blackfeet believed disease was caused by an evil spirit entering a person’s body and that it could be cured by a doctor who possessed the power to expell the spirit. As Blackfoot doctors received their detailed instructions for curing the sick in dreams, their methods differed. Many, however, employed singing, drumming, and calling upon their supernatural helper for assistance. Not uncommonly, the doctor appeared to extract some small object from the sick person’s body as proof that the cause of illness had been removed. Some doctors were specialists in treating broken bones, snake bites, or battle wounds. Many of the most renowned doctors were women. It was customary to pay the doctor one or more horses for his services. The family of a victim of a prolonged illness might give all their possessions to the Indian doctor.

The Blackfeet had a Love medicine, which they called Ito-wa-mami-wa-natsi (Cree medicine), because it was generally obtained from the Crees, who were specialists in its manufacture. In talking with E-kum-makon about the Cree medicine, he said that he had used it to regain the affection of his young wife. When she left him and returned to her father’s lodge, he made a long journey north, to visit a Cree medicine man, from whom he purchased some of the Love medicine. It consisted of a small beaded buckskin bag containing a sweet-smelling powder. As the Cree magician had directed, he secured one of his wife’s hairs and, winding it with one of his own, placed them together in the medicine bag. He carried it with him everywhere, fastened around his neck by a buckskin string and wore it beneath his shirt. He firmly believed in its power, because his wife had returned and became so much attached to him, that she was unwilling to leave his side and they went everywhere together. Soon after this E-kum-makon had a severe illness, lasting so long he thought he must be bewitched by Little Plume, who owned a Porcupine-Quill medicine. It consisted of a small stone, or wooden image of a person, a porcupine quill and some red paint, by which the owner was able to cast an evil spell over people. [Page 191] If he placed the red paint between the eyes of the image, the one whom he desired to injure became ill; if over the lungs, he had a hemorrhage; if on the top of the head, he became crazy; if over the heart, it caused death. E-kum-makon became so worried over his health, that he again sought the advice of the Cree medicine man, who informed him that his sickness was caused by the improper use of the Love medicine. It should not have been carried around with him, but left inside his tipi, tied to one of the lodge poles, where it properly belonged. The medicine man also explained, that it was wrong to put the hairs into the bag without the burning of incense, which was necessary to ward off the Evil Power.

--p
A sensitivity to the stars is apparent in nearly every aspect of Skidi life, as was indicated by Murie and Dorsey:
At birth a child came under the influence of a supernatural being--a particular star shining especially bright--who was supposed to manifest himself later in the child’s life. Usually this manifestation occurred when the child fell ill, at which time medicine-men were sent for. When the right one appeared, he could cure the child, for he possessed the power from the star noted above [1940:115].
Weltfish, speaking of the Pawnee person, observed:
He was literally trained to feel that the world around him was his home--kahuraru, the universe, meaning literally the inside land, and that his house was a small model of it. The infinite cosmos was his constant source of strength and his ultimate progenitor...[1977:57-58].
Thus all the Skidi people apparently were quite familiar with the stars at one time. But it was the priests who were the most knowledgeable of all, as the quotation from Murie which began this chapter indicates. Murie also appropriately drew attention to the fact that we now possess few of the actual details of the Skidi system: “The reader should always bear in mind that we are [Page 166] catching up the frayed-out ends of a vanishing fabric and that many times these come to us as but glimpses of what has passed into hopeless oblivion.” In this chapter we will use geometry, together with the reliable repetitions of astronomy, to attempt to reconstruct at least a part of the pattern of that vanished fabric.

The Pawnee recognized witchcraft and, ultimately, anger and hostility, to be a major cause of disease. Pawnee religious specialists also included shamans who cured the sick through powers believed to have been acquired from animal spirits. Shamans were organized into societies with specific rituals performed twice each year in order to perpetuate and renew their powers.

Before a duma is ready to be installed in its piki house, it must be levelled off by grinding with coarse gravel or by pounding with a rock until it is smooth and even. Cotton seed is then chewed or ground to extract an oil with which the stone is carefully polished. The actual installation must be performed in secret by a skilled baker. If the owner of the new stone lacks the necessary experience, she calls on a trusted kinswoman to act for her, but if a woman has the requisite skill, she may do the work herself. 69 After the duma is in [Page p.198] position, a fire is built under it with piñon wood as fuel. It is regulated carefully to a medium heat as excessive firing would tend to crack the stone. Once the stone is heated to the right degree a quantity of piñon sap is rubbed in thoroughly, after which an oily mixture of crushed watermelon seeds is applied and allowed to penetrate.
69 In a case where a spiteful or jealous woman was picked, she might easily contrive to damage the new stone.

Hopinavoti is the general category of Hopi ideation that provides thoroughgoing analyses that are comparable to anthropological analyses, in that they stem from a demarcated tradition of interpretation that is specialized, restricted, and “expert.” Navoti indicates a system of knowledge that includes philosophy, science, and theology and incorporates conceptual models for explaining the past and predicting, or “prophesying,” future events (for those convinced that Hopi is a “timeless language,” see Malotki's 1982 critique of Whorf's view): in short, it is a sort of Hopi hermeneutics. The predictive element and the temporal connection between cause and effect mean that present conditions can be explained by reference to past predictions and that future events will in some way reflect contemporary “prophecy”—a term used for navoti in Hopi English (“theory” is another).
The nature and depth of understanding of Hopinavoti differs. Sukavungsinom are regarded as having a shallower understanding than pavansinom. With regard to ritual symbolism, for example, discrete layers of meaning are recognized by the more knowledgeable, who can and do identify the more profound layers in appropriate circumstances. An obvious parallel in western society is between the knowledge claimed by the academic community and the intelligentsia in general over the meanings and functioning of phenomena, and the “common-sense” understandings of the “general public.” However, the structure of knowledge distribution in Hopi society departs from this parallel and is more aptly compared to established ecclesiastical structures differentiating a clerical hierarchy from a laity. The boundaries separating a navotiytaqa (literally, a “man of knowledge”—a common term for distinguishing the validity of an interpretation's source) from others are maintained by strict controls on access to knowledge. We might portray the sociology of Hopi knowledge as a series of concentric rings marking boundaries of secrecy between circles of knowledge or, as [Page 256] Barth (1975:passim) suggests for the Baktaman, as an assemblage of Chinese boxes.

“On one occasion a celebrated rain-maker had to enlist the help of other magicians and sundry old men to help him break the drought that for a long time past had held Deep Well in an iron grip. (1) To this end they performed many secret ceremonies. They then went to the ranges and, standing on the top of one, waved in circles eagle-hawk's wings held in both hands, to draw in their direction the promising clouds that were rising. The rain [70] came, and continued far too long for the rain-maker's comfort; so he again enlisted the help of his former assistants to stop it. This was accomplished by the whole of them shouting their loudest, and striking at the rain with sticks, and assuming all sorts of threatening attitudes. After this notable success he was regarded by all as a specialist at the game.

Another form of Arungquilta which produces comets is brought about in the following way, and is only used for punishing women. If a woman runs away from her husband and he is unable to recover her, he and his friends-that is, men of his local group--assemble at a secluded spot, where a man skilled in magic draws upon the surface of a small patch of ground, which has been cleared and smoothed down for the purpose, a rough diagram, of which the accompanying sketch is a copy. This drawing is simply marked out on the ground with the finger, and is intended to represent the figure of the woman lying down on her back. It is called Aworra, a term which has much the same significance as the word emblem. 1 While the drawing is being made, and throughout the whole proceedings, low chants are sung, the burden of which is an exhortation to the Arungquilta to go out and enter her body and dry up all of her fat. When the drawing is done, a piece of green bark is placed at the spot marked with an asterisk. This is supposed to represent the spirit part of the woman, and then all the men who are present stick into it a number of miniature spears, which have been made for the purpose and have been “sung.” The spears, with the bark into which they are fixed, are then flung as far as they can be thrown in the direction in which the woman is supposed to be. The party now returns to camp, [Page 417] and sooner or later, very often after the lapse of a considerable time, the woman's fat dries up, she dies, and her ulthana, or spirit appears in the sky in the form of a shooting-star.

To the native the Iruntarinia is a very real personage, who, as a general rule, is a beneficent being, though at times capable of great cruelty; he is, in fact, a man of the Alchera endowed with all the powers possessed by such an one. If he be offended, then he may place in the body of the offender one of his pointing-sticks, or Ullinka, which as a general rule is a barbed stick a few inches in length and attached to a string, the malicious pulling of which causes severe pain, and the stick can only be removed by the aid of a very skilled medicine man.

Magic: the relation between spirits and man . Having discussed spirits and man we may now inquire into the nature of communication between the two. We have already dealt with the guardian spirit institution which enables almost everyone to make contact with the spirits. Nevertheless there are more formalized relations between spirits and men which are carried on by special individuals. While all death and sickness are regarded as caused by evil spirits—wealth, success, and health may be brought to an individual by his guardian spirit. To manipulate the spirits of both types one has to command knowledge of the formalized behavior that is believed to control the spirits and sometimes be able to accomplish the desired task even without their help. Such formalized behavior is called magic and the specialists in it are shamans and sorcerers. The first term is applied here to a man using “white magic,” the latter to an obnoxious individual employing “black magic” for selfish reasons. The Kapauku also make the differentiation, calling a shaman “ kamu epi me, white-magic-know man,” and “ kego epi me, black-magic-know man.”
Shaman.—A shaman, or kamu epi me, is always a middle-aged man or woman, in good health. An old, weak individual shows by his physical condition that he cannot take care of his own health, and certainly cannot be helpful to others. A young individual, in his or her “teens,” would lack the experience necessary for successful performances. All the shamans the writer saw were healthy, muscular, athleticlooking people, usually rich and successful in their economic and political pursuits. Personal success is proof to the Kapauku of a man’s power. How can a man who is not capable of acquiring good health and financial prosperity for himself help others to the same things? A shaman must also be a fast talker with a convincing voice and respectable behavior. He commands spiritual powers which an ordinary man lacks. He usually has more than one guardian spirit. To be a shaman one must have as helpers not only souls and tene of the dead relatives, but also an important spirit, as for example Tege, the horrible demon of the woods, Madou, the water spirit, Ukwaanija, the wife of Tege, or Makiutija, the ghost of the earth. These spirits are effective as helpers not only for chasing away other evil spirits but, by having power over them, the shaman obviously can cure a man whose sickness has been caused by one of the species he commands. Thus a Kapauku looks for a shaman helped by Madou when he believes the latter is the trouble-maker. Ijaaj Ekajewaijokaipouga [Page 25] of Aigii, the headman of the Ijaaj-Pigome confederacy had five departed souls and tene, and twelve different evil spirits as his helpers. Being an excellent speaker, muscular, healthy, very rich, and a political leader as well as a brave warrior, he was considered one of the best curers in the valley.
The profession of shaman is open to everyone irrespective of sex, position, or age. Nevertheless, only individuals with the above mentioned qualifications tend to be recognized by the society. One becomes a shaman not by learning but because of the power that comes through dreams and visions in which one acquires spirit helpers and is taught by them specific cures. Dreams also tell the shaman the nature of the disease of a particular man and prescribe a suitable cure. The society recognizes a man as a shaman when he performs several successful cures and tends to have the above mentioned characteristics. A shaman has no supernatural powers himself. The cure is performed for him by his spirit-helpers. They tell him the formula in dreams, or they possess the shaman and talk through his mouth in a high-pitched voice and like a machine-gun that is firing. Other people listen to the talk and interpret it, the shaman in this case acting as a medium. The advantages associated with shamanism lead everybody to envy the lucky man. He is most respected. From his activities, he derives only friends and no enemies. For a single cure he is paid from two to six true Kapauku cowries. His political and legal authority, if he happens to have any, become more prominent with his success in the field of magic...
The above elements are used in the categories of magic which follow. Shamans differ in the selection of elements and in their own peculiar choice of the wording of a magical spell, of the way they use their bows and arrows, and of repetition and sequences of the techniques. They also differ in eloquence and knowledge of the lore, and in the selection of paraphernalia.
Preventive magic is used when one man suspects another individual of sending an evil spirit to kill him. He prefers having the magic performed prior to the onset of the disease. The procedure is almost exactly the same as in magic used for the curative purposes described below.
Curative magic is used after a man has been attacked by an evil spirit which tries to scare away the soul. The shaman tries to expell the spirit by bribing it with offerings and frightening it away by his power. This type of magic is the most common of all the categories discussed. All the techniques and the general sequence outlined above are employed. At the end of the process, the shaman makes recommendations about the continuation of the treatment of the patient. He may suggest another practitioner. Very often he asks the sick man for an expression of generosity as a condition for complete recovery. This is usually a pig-killing and free distribution of the meat to the public. The sick man may also be requested to set aside a certain quantity of cowries for his son’s inheritance.
Counter-magic takes place when a man is believed to be a victim of sorcery. The objectives are twofold. Not only should the patient be relieved of the spell and rid of the evil spirit but counter-magic should be used to send back the evil spirit to kill the sorcerer. Since this is considerable to ask of a spirit, the performance is more elaborate, the bribes are more numerous, and greater generosity is required. Kapauku call this type “ kego ekig[unknown]ai, to untie the black magic.”...
Magic for economic profit, such as earning much shell money and thus gaining prestige, is used by the giver of a pig feast at two occasions. One is the day when the people gather to start the construction of the dance house and the other the night prior to the putu duwai naago, the day when pigs are slaughtered and the pork sold. At both occasions the magic can be divided into two parts: a prayer by the feast owner to Ugatame, to his guardian spirits, and to his own soul to make the feast a success, thus bringing him much shell money and prestige; and the magic performance itself, consisting of an offering of rat’s intestines to influence the “flow of cowries.”

In the above case, the relationship is activated only by the spirit while the tree is just a passive phenomenon. Nevertheless, there are plants in the Kapauku universe which are active and affect the spirits rather than vice versa. Some plants, already discussed, are traditionally associated with certain species of spirits and are believed to have some power which controls them. By the shaman’s manipulation of these plants, the spirits are induced to obey the wishes of the expert. Ude kopa and jukune, another Ti plant, occupy a special position among the plants mentioned because both have a generalized power which controls most of the supernatural beings and compels them to help with white magic in case the first plant is used, and with black magic if one uses the second.

Trobrianders believe in spirits who reside in the bush who cause illness and death but the greatest source of fear is sorcery. Only some people are believed to have the knowledge of spells that will "poison" a person and such experts can be petitioned to exercise their power for others. Counterspells are also known; chemical poisons obtained from elsewhere are thought to be prevalent. In addition, magic spells are chanted for many other desires, such as control over the weather, love, beauty, carving expertise, yam gardening, and sailing. Mission teachers have not disrupted the strong beliefs and practices of magic. Recently, villagers from two hamlets have introduced a new fundamentalist religion whose tenets negate the practice of magic.
PRACTITIONERS
Most villagers own some magic spells, but only certain women and men are known to have the most sought after and powerful spells for gardening, weather, and sorcery. The most powerful spells are owned by the Omarakana chief. Some villages have resident mission catechists who conduct Sunday church services.

Almost every death that occurs is believed to be the result of sorcery ( bwagau ) effected by a specialist who chants magic spells into the victim's betel nut or tobacco. Villagers chew betel and smoke in addictive ways, and these objects, which they continually take from each other, are used as the agents of illness and death. Only when a person is very old and dies while asleep is death considered “natural.” Then villagers simply say, “His time was up; he lived a full life without angering anyone.”...

Flying witches may attack a person at any time, but dark nights are especially dangerous. Therefore, on moonless nights, most villagers pull their doors tightly shut and go to sleep early, whereas when the full moon ascends people move freely about until quite late and young people's laughter rings out into the early morning hours. Dark nights intensify villagers' fears, for they also believe that plans and payments for sorcery are made at these times, often at some specially arranged place in the bush so no one else is witness to the meetings. A specialist can refuse a person's request to perform the magic, and sometimes he even will warn the intended victim. Planning sorcery through someone else has its own dangers. Only those who know the magic spells have the power to act autonomously.

There are thought to be at least seven different sea demons in the waters near Fáánakkar. They frequently cause a dangerous illness ( sáát) in persons who venture out to sea or who visit the reef islands. Like other evil spirits they attack by entering the victim’s body and devouring his insides. When possession by sea demons is suspected to be the cause of an illness, divination is used to confirm the diagnosis and to [Page 20] identify the particular sea demon responsible. Specialists then prepare an appropriate herbal remedy designed to drive out the sea demon. If this is unsuccessful the victim dies. ...
While he was out fishing by himself one night, a man from the other islands fell asleep on his paddling canoe. He was awakened by a beautiful girl who asked him for a cigarette. When he said he had none, she told him to wait for her. She went over the side of the canoe and returned half an hour later with a pack of cigarettes. He was very attracted to the girl. When she asked that they “marry” he quickly agreed and they made love on the canoe. Afterwards the girl ordered him to tell no one. She also asked him to return to the same spot the next night, promising that he would catch many fish. The next night he returned and slept with the girl again. Afterwards he began to go crazy. Each night he went out to meet the sea demon. By day he gave away the many fish he caught. His people went looking for him and found him on another island, but his words were crazy and he spoke out loud to himself. They took him back to his home island. His stomach swelled up as if he were pregnant. Local medical treatment failed to help and he was taken to a well known curer, an expert in massage, on another island. There he finally told about himself and the girl. That night the sea demon returned and asked him why he had talked. She said she would kill him. A day or two later he died.
A girl lagged behind the other women while she was out on a fishing expedition in the lagoon shallows. She saw a handsome man on a partially sunken World War II Japanese ship. He called out to her in ghost language and she was greatly taken with him. When her companions returned they found her wandering about the ship repeating the words the sea demon had uttered. They dragged her back to the island but she died the same day.

As we shall see, use of knowledge is also typically conceptualized as a contest or battle between the power of the expert and whatever he is seeking to control, whether this be a person, a storm, a disease, or a building. If the knowledge works, it is a triumph for the expert; the phenomenon he has controlled is described as having “lost to” or “feared” the expert and his knowledge. Because of strong thought, experts want to match or outdo the accomplishments of those who practice the same specialty. Not only do rivals compete indirectly over their reputations for success, they may also come together for a direct “fight with knowledge.” In these showdowns, as when two specialists engage in a sorcery battle, the ideals of competitive strong thought and aggressive bravery reach their peak expression.

The fighting expert knows a series of secret judo-like holds, sometimes referred to as “Trukese fighting” ( fiyuuwen chuuk), each of which renders an opponent helpless, allows the expert to throw him to the ground, or injures him. As a master casually observed while teaching me one technique, “Here it is best if your opponent’s arm breaks, it is number one if his arm breaks.” Many techniques are designed for use against an assailant who is armed with a particular weapon such as a knife, a machete, a pair of sharks teeth knuckle dusters, a club, or a spear. One of many holds that can be used against a knife wielding attacker goes as follows:
The expert ducks away to the left when his opponent slashes at him, catches his wrist, and throws his weight downward as he pivots around behind him. Reaching between his opponent’s legs, he transfers his grip on the other’s wrist and stands up, jerking the other’s arm up with him. This sequence, performed in one fast-flowing movement, leaves the expert standing upright behind the assailant who is helplessly bent over, his arm extending back between his legs in the grip of the expert. Having relieved his opponent of his knife, the expert now has several choices. By pushing downward on the other’s back and pulling his arm, he can drive him face first into the dirt. Alternatively he can drag him about and torment him. This is considered a particularly useful hold when confronted with two or three attackers. If the expert [Page 142] catches one of them in it, he can swing him around easily and ward off attacks, attempts to stab the expert are likely to be received by his victim.
While knowledge of holds is the basis of an expert’s power, the true master has the mental concentration necessary for using them effectively in a dangerous situation. When he teaches an apprentice, an expert tells his student that a person with “right thought” ( ekiyekééch) and five holds is the master of an opponent with one hundred holds. As a fight develops, he tells his apprentice, the “first born feeling” will be fear. However, with right thought this will give way to the “next born, bravery”. He says that a person’s fear arises from concern about injury or death, attachment to his people, and anxiety over their fate should he die. What must be done, the expert says, is to “throw out” such thoughts and think instead, “So what if I die?” ( meyit ika wúwa máánó). With this attitude, “You will not die, you will be able to perform the techniques that you know, and you will destroy your opponent.”
Fighting knowledge is held in great respect, and it is taken for granted that an expert can defeat a number of stronger enemies. When threatened by a knife-wielding opponent, he may threaten him in return, “It is impossible for me to be injured by your knife, but you, you will be felled by my knowledge.” However, a reputation for prowess can lead an expert into many conflicts, because other experts will seek him out in order to test their power against him. Ideally, the challenger visits the expert, offers a respectful greeting, and humbly requests they fight. The expert should politely deny much knowledge but agree to fight. He may also politely decline, but this can lead to a loss of prestige. Sometimes a challenger makes an arrogant request or, feigning anger or drunkeness, simply attacks. When a fight starts, others will try to determine the expert’s techniques by studying his movements. This is difficult, partly because of the speed with which they are executed.
When a master gives his knowledge to an apprentice, it is said that he accompanies his pupil into all his subsequent conflicts. The competition between rival masters extends into the relations of their students. If his student loses a fight, it is [Page 143] a loss for the master as well. There are several elaborations of this idea. Instead of instructing a single apprentice secretly out in the bush, an expert may start a fighting school and teach a group of students together. This may extend for several weeks or even months. Because it is a public claim of power, opening such a school is arrogant. When a rival master learns that a school is in session, he may respond by taking one of his students and invading the meeting house where the school is held, a challenge which must be immediately answered. The teacher selects one of his pupils, and the two students fight it out. If the outsider is beaten, he and his master are derided and thrown out of the meeting house. If the student from the school loses, his master has lost, and the school is ended.

Magic is also available if more direct means are not effective in evoking a response to one’s advances. While its use was undoubtedly more prevalent formerly, love magic did not belong to the body of more esoteric lore which was reserved primarily to the master magicians and is thus still known and used today. In fact, the most knowledgeable practitioners are often women, and while it is usually discussed in terms of its use by men, as appropriate to their function as initiators of liaisons, it is significant that women also resort to it on occasion. The most common forms which love magic take are perfumed ointments which are surreptitiously rubbed on the person whom one desires, and powders or other preparations which are mixed with something the person may be induced to drink. In either case both the substances and the spells which have been said over them are calculated to arouse the desires of the recipient more or less exclusively toward the supplicant. Charms may be concealed in the clothing of a hopeful lover, which will make him irresistibly attractive; these are plaited with suitable spells from the midrib of a coconut leaf. The love for a rival may also be dissipated by magic, the objective being the rather unusual one of making the woman associate the rival with feces. Some of the spells refer to the rival as feces, and a more direct effect may be produced by mixing a little feces (not necessarily of the rival) with an appropriate plant and secreting the mixture, after reciting spells over it, in the woman’s house; after this whenever she thinks of the rival she thinks too of feces. Or a bit of feces, properly dedicated to the rival, may be put in a coconut husk and put in the sea where it will drift away with the current and carry her affection for the other man away with it.

Consequently when treatment fails to bring immediate relief, re-evaluation and a change in direction is called for. This is the principal reason, to the utter bewilderment of modern medical practitioners, that Trukese in-patients seek early release from the hospital whenever their condition fails to improve quickly and dramatically. 3
3 It may be noted that patients are often released from the hospital after medical personnel think they have been cured, but before they have recovered their full strength. Convinced they are still sick, such patients then continue with local therapy. If they eventually recover their strength completely, the cure is attributed, not to the hospital but to the medicine being taken when all symptoms finally vanished.

The most important and most prestigious branch of the spirit power ‘Massage’ is the one used for bone setting which is [Page 201] known as ‘massage for blows’ ( rawan ffėn) or ‘massage for falling down’ ( rawan pėwtitiw). One of the most significant pieces of information that must be acquired by a practitioner of this branch of knowledge is all the dozens of terms used to identify the various landmarks or faan located all over the body. These terms are all secret, and novices may spend months, sometimes even years, committing all these secretly named body locations to memory.

Similarly, a few Trukese innovators have abandoned the Trukese paradigm for illness (which views spirit powers both as causing illness and providing cures) in favor of a modern, scientific medical paradigm for illness. To my knowledge there are four such Trukese at the present time; three of them are medical practitioners and one of them is a nurse. These people sometimes speak critically, and occasionally even disparagingly, about the notion that spirit powers can either cause or cure illness.
Most other Trukese are not familiar with the evidence to which these people have had access, nor are they very much aware of the alternative paradigm for which they have opted. They continue to adhere to the older paradigm, revising it when necessary to account for perceived events which would otherwise be completely mysterious.

On the island of Kambara, situated fifty miles by sailing canoe from the nearest native medical practitioner at Lakemba, and 200 miles from the nearest European doctor and hospital at Levuka, the natives are still dependent upon their own methods for treating the sick.
The Kambarans believe that illness and death have various superhuman causes such as the possession of the body by an evil spirit, the loss of the “good soul”, black magic, the infraction of a tabu, or the smell of a dead body. Every doctor, male or female, is a specialist in one or more of these types of illness and uses his own secret medicines which he has acquired by inheritance from a relative, by a dream from an ancestor, or by a guardian spirit through the “Water Baby” cult. A doctor holds an important position in the community, and medicine is used by many as a means of increasing social prestige.
A sick person usually goes first to a diagnostician, who makes an examination by tapping the body and inserting a finger into the mouth, anus, or vagina. The diagnostician tells the patient which specialist knows medicines to treat his particular type of malady...
The cure of a case of spirit possession is accomplished by a method curiously similar to that used in psychoanalysis. The Lauan theory is that the doctor must draw a confession of the name of the spirit from the patient in order to release the spirit from his body. The doctor sees the patient every day, tries to allay his fears, encourages him, talks to him [Page 126] about the spirit, gives him potions of herbs to drink, and rubs his body with medicines. Finally in the course of the treatment, when the doctor touches the part of the body in which the spirit dwells, the patient will cry out. The doctor presses the affected part until it hurts and asks “Who is it?” and in great distress the patient calls the name of the spirit. Immediately the spirit leaves him and he begins to recover.

Technology again comes into relation with the religious ideas of the Tikopia. The borer, it is believed, can be coped with not only by physical means but also by the power of the gods. Adzes of a size for hewing out canoes are scarce in Tikopia and each is a most prized possession. That which belongs to the chiefly family of Taumako is especially valuable. When the chiefs of other clans wish to build their canoes they invite the experts [Page 122] from this family as a rule to come and perform the work. It is an old custom since their skill in canoe building is traditional. But there is an additional reason. Their adze is believed to have the power of killing any borer that may be in the timber and stopping decay. Like other valued property it has its own tutelary deity, in this case Pusi, whose incarnation is the grey reef eel, noted for the sharpness of its teeth and its ferocity. When the adze is struck on to the wood the deity is invoked:--
“Thy friend, Pusiuraura
Let it be bitten by thy sacred tooth.”
Then, say the natives, “the decay and the borer disappear. He eats them on the instant, they vanish, and the insect dies.” Because of the power of this adze it is not as freely lent as those of lesser importance are. “It goes only with the men of their chiefly family, it is not handed over loosely, it goes only with them. It is not given to the clan, it is tapu , because it is the tooth of the deity,” said the Ariki Kafika. Before using the tool the expert, Pa Tarikitoa, dedicates it in a few words to his dead brother as former user, and to the deity.
Acknowledgment must be made to the deity for this specific type of service. I was told that when the food portion of the expert would be given to him at the first meal he would say “Tie it up! Tie it up and carry it to the chief.” It would then be carried to the Ariki Taumako, who would throw offerings from it to the deity of the adze. If this were not done then Pa Tarikitoa himself would throw offerings, saying as follows:--
“Recite a formula hither Pa Taumako
For the food of Pusiuraura
Light be your premier adze
Light be the path of your adze
Anything destructive for the timber here
Let it be eaten by you, Pusiuraura.”
Moreover, later a basket of food and a bundle of green coco-nuts were carried to the Ariki Taumako as “the payment for his adze”, meaning for the use of it. I have mentioned that the adze is spoken of as the “tooth” of the deity. I was told that if the god is angered by some action or negligence of the expert who is wielding the tool he will cause it to slip and cut his foot. Here is a special sanction for care in the work, and an explanation of accident in supernatural terms...
The expert justified his position by his technical competence. He obviously “carried the job in his head” as a carpenter would say. He made his adze strokes, then glanced sideways, measuring by eye sizes and lengths and the extension of his cutting. He clearly was calculating the effect of his cut on the set of the timber at any particular spot. When the two timbers were put together for marking they were held by the whole crowd of men while he ran round with his charcoal stick drawing his line. 1 He himself began the dressing of the timber from the mark. He was assisted at first by Pa Taramoa, a son of the Ariki, who asked his advice. “Pa Tarikitoa! I shall strike on the charcoal there?” wanting to know if he should cut away the mark itself. The expert answered with an affirmative jerk of the head. “Cut.” An energetic man, he did not waste words. Pa Taramoa was told how to strike the correct type of blow by his brother, and this was confirmed by the expert.
In the late afternoon another ceremony was performed--the kava of the canoe. Food from a large oven was brought into the chief's house, a series of libations poured, and offerings made to the gods of the vessel and of the chief. About a dozen men were present inside, but the expert and some of the workers refused an invitation to come in. “He eats at the side of the timber; he sits and throws his offerings there,” was the comment when I asked why the expert did not enter. Such is the usual custom, it was said. The convention of work is that the expert should remain by his job. This is a moral imperative which has the general function of maintaining economic efficiency. Kindred obligations are to be at the scene of work at or soon after day-break; not to leave the work to get on with other tasks; and not to dally in eating meals...
The reasons for haste can be summarized thus. There is the ritual drive--a cance in pieces is in a sense an offence to the tutelary spirits who have charge of it. There is the energy of the expert himself, who in this case was a bustling person in all his activities. Such an attitude towards work in progress is common. It is associated with the possibility of going off to another task on the following day. Claims of the cultivations and of fishing or of other woodwork may press, not least upon the expert himself. There is also the stimulus given by the chief, partly due to his own wish to see the task finished and partly, though not obviously expressed, to the fact that he will then not have to feed the workers for a further day. All this of course contradicts a popular notion that the savage treats his work like play and is incapable of haste.

Firth, Raymond. 1937. “Tatooing in Tikopia.” Man Vol. 36: 173–77.

--p
The Tikopia word for tattoo marks in general is tau , and the operation of tattooing is known as ta tau, ta being the generic term for the act of striking. It refers to the rechnicai process involved. Tattooing is usually done by recognized experts ( tufua ta tau ), who have obtained their reputation through favourable comment passed by people upon the skilful treatment of their subjects. Such an expert is often a craftsman in other activities as well; if a Tikopia has technical skill in the handling of tools he can apply his energies in as many directions as he wishes no trades are closed to him. But an expert has often been assisted by knowledge of the art having been transmitted in his family.
One of my informants learn from his father and also from his mother's brother; another was taught by his grandfather, though his father also was a tattooing expert and a canoe builder. The family of a third had been tattooers for generations. His father and grandfather were noted for their skill. When I asked him if he had learnt from his father he said “Yes, but it depends also “on the knowledgeable mind.” By this he meant a certain amount of natural aptitude.
A person who wants to be tattooed goes to any expert he fancies. Frequently he asks a close relative to operate upon him, but he may pass over such a man and go to another. For instance, when I was there a young man. Futikena, did not go to his father's brother, Pa Tarikitoa, a well-known practitioner, but to Pa Taraoro, a man of different clan. He gave as a reason that the tapping-stick of the former was heavy, that is, the tattooing implement was struck too hard, so that the operation was painful. This he had heard from other people, he said, and so preferred to go outside the family circle. Firimori, the small son of Pa Nukufuri, had three fish motifs, one on his forehead and one on each cheek, tattooed by his father's brother, Pa Paiu. “The stupid, Pa Paiu,” said Pa Nukufuri, smiling. Pa Paiu is not a recognized expert, but was trying his hand on the lad to gain experience. Experts are not common: there were three only in the village of Matautu where I lived. One of them was Fopeni, seen at work in the accompanying photograph (Fig. 1): the others were the brothers Pa Nukuomanu and Pa Nukutauriri. They happened to be all of Kafika clan, though [Page p. 174 (b)] the dominant group of the village was the clan of Tafua--such alignment is not significant in any of the ordinary crafts...
The tattooer pours a few drops of water into his tiny cup and shakes a little soot into it. This is mixed or ‘pounded’ with the stem of kau[unknown]asu wood--Fopeni told me that no other kind will do, but whether for magical or for technical reasons I neglected to inquire. The patient lies down on a floor mat. The operation is usually done in the hut of the expert but, as in the case photographed, when the light is bad there the work is done out of doors in the shade of a house. The design is roughly marked out on the skin of the patient with the paigmented kau[unknown]asu stem. The matau is also dipped in the pigment, put to the skin and the adze-blade struck with the tapping-stick. The teeth of the blade pierce the skin, a little blood flows, and the skin is pulled up a little as the teeth are with-drawn. The implement is held between the first finger and thumb and sometimes the flat end of the haft is braced against the little finger. Usually the hand is steadied by holding the three lower fingers on the mat, or on the patient, as the case may be. The photograph, taken while the tattooer was at work, shows the method. The apping-stick is held also between the thumb and first finger. The patient, stretched out at full length, holds in one hand a rag of bark-cloth which the expert takes from time to time to wipe away the accumulated blood and pigment. The motion of tapping is termed ta. The line of the design is called ‘the path’ ( ta ara ). At intervals it is touched-up or redrawn by the expert who dips the kau[unknown]asu stem in the liquid and moistens with it the matau blade. When the expert is in doubt an observer, of whom there are usually several, may assist him. “That's the line” he points, and adds “Mark it.” And the expert then sketches it in plainly. Unsolicited comment of this kind is frequent in Tikopia craft-work, and is accepted by experts for what it is worth. The pencil-shaped fatuke , sharpened to an edge, is used occasionally to clean out the teeth of the matau and make them keener by rubbing it in the grooves between them.

In early 1781, for example, Alabi confronted a set of beliefs that Saramakas considered simply common sense: that children born with certain unusual characteristics (e.g., albinism, polydactylism) were gods, whose mortal lives required special treatment. 76
76. During the initial months of missionization, one of the Moravians described Saramaka beliefs about albinos.
[At Captain Etja’s village of Dosu Creek] I saw a little negro lad with rather white skin and with hair that resembled white sheep’s wool, although his father and mother were black. The negroes regard such children as young gods and they let them do whatever they want, in order not to hinder them and so that they do not leave them. I have heard that such poor creatures are born rarely and almost never live to be old. When they do become a little older and something dreadful occurs, then they commit suicide. They are then not buried like other people but are thrown into deep water, so that they can return unhindered to the place whence they came. (St 3, pt. 1, 87-88)
Saramakas call albinos wéti-gádu (literally, “white gods”) and consider them, as well as children with “red” hair, to be closely associated with tone water spirits. Brother Riemer described how some of these children were prepared to be ritual specialists:
If nature distinguishes a youth by something special, for example unusual facial features, a long nose, a pointy chin, unusual height, red hair, or something of the like, then he is destined for special training, and from childhood he will be put under the supervision of a famous witch doctor, who will teach him the art of herbs and all the other great mysteries of his art. Such a man [is like] a born miracle worker. (St 3, pt. 2, 265)
Saramakas also distinguished other “special births.” For example-as throughout West and Central Africa-twins were considered gods and (along with their parents, as well as the child who followed in the birth order) were subjected to complex rituals from birth to death (see R. Price 1983a, 60-61).

Very often, one or more of the adult men in a maloca group will be recognised as a specialist in some aspect of ritual. Some men are specialist dancers ( baya ) who have a large repertoire of dance-songs and who know well the complicated steps and movements associated with each dance. Others are specialist chanters ( yoam[unknown] ) who can recite in detail the traditions of origin of the group. These men act as leaders for the long sessions of chanting, involving all adult men, that form an integral part of communal rituals. Very often these two roles overlap so that specialist dancers are also chanters and vice versa. A third specialist ritual occupation relates to shamanism. Amongst the Barasana, there is no absolute difference between those men recognised as shamans and those who are not. At the lowest level, most adult men have some abilities as shamans and will carry out some of the same functions as those men who have a widespread reputation for their powers and knowledge. The most common function that shamans perform involves the treatment of food and other things by blowing spells. The breath is believed to be the manifestation and seat of the soul or spirit ( [unknown]s[unknown] ). By controlled breathing, accompanied by muttered spells, the shaman can direct the power of his spirit or soul towards a specific end. Blowing not only has curative and protective power, but also imparts life force and can change the state of being of a person or an object. 5
The Barasana have a verb base - that covers the activities of shamans in general. I have translated this as ‘blow, blowing’ as this action is a common feature of these activities. In many respects this closely parallels the Akawaio concept of taling discussed by Butt (1956).
All foods are ranked into a graded series of relative danger; at one end are such things as mother’s milk, at the other certain large species of animal and fish which are most dangerous of all. After birth, each new category of food that a person eats must first be rendered safe by a shaman who blows spells over a sample which is then given to the subject to eat. By about eight or nine years, a young boy or girl will be able to eat all but the most dangerous categories. After initiation or first menstruation, the person must start again from the beginning of the series and it may take three or four years before they can eat all the foods of a normal adult diet. Birth, menstruation, snake bite, illness, death in the community, participation in communal rituals and a number of other factors will all render specific categories of individual subject to danger from specific categories of food which must be treated by a shaman prior [Page 33] to consumption. Most adult men know the requisite spells for the treatment of the less dangerous foods, but only a few, the most powerful and knowledgeable, are able to treat the most dangerous categories. In similar fashion, most adult men know something about the curing of minor ailments, but very few know how to cure serious illness. There is a graded series of curing techniques and only the most widely known shamans know all of them.
Shamans are thus ranked according to their knowledge and abilities. Their powers are founded upon their knowledge of myths. Most adult men know a considerable number of myths but shamans differ from the rest in two respects: first, they know more myths, and secondly, they know and understand the esoteric meaning behind them. In the hands of the shamans, myths are not merely sacred tales or stories, but things with inherent power, and it is upon these myths that shamanic spells are based.

The urine of the cow, or that of a black she-burro, is taken to cure jaundice. The urine of the skunk is thought to blind human beings. Human urine has many medicinal uses among the Aymara. Newborn babies are given spoonfuls of human urine (especially that of young children) until the milk appears in the mother. Fermented human urine, tamata , is also widely used. Every house has its yuru ( tamatutu or tamat waku[unknown]la ) or pottery jar for saving urine; compare Bertonio (Vol. 2, p. 81) “Chillami: Orinal como bacinilla o mate.” When a person gets the mange, they say that he is ora[unknown]en katxata , “caught or [Page 175] fished by the earth”; washing with tamata or “orina podrida” is one of the best cures for this disease. For this term, compare Bertonio (Vol. 2, p. 238) “Ttamatayacca: Orines podridos.” Aymara women wash their hair in fer mented urine, as it is said to kill fleas, lapanaka , in the hair, as well as to “cut” the grease because of the ammonia in it; very dirty and greasy clothes are also sometimes washed in tamata . When a person has a fever, he is washed all over with fermented human urine; Garcilaso (bk. ii, ch. XXIV) says that when a suckling was feverish, it was washed in urine in the morning, and if they could obtain some of the child's own urine, it was given to it to drink. As has already been mentioned, urine is also mixed with other substances, notably with the viscous pounded mass of the berries of some of the American mistletoes ( Phoradendron spp., Loranthaceae) as an ointment. When a glandular or goitrous swelling is adjudged to have come from contact with the spittle of a frog, the place is washed with tamata and salt. When a baby is sick, the mi[unknown]lu[unknown]cana ceremony may be performed by the yatiri (one type of Aymara medicine-man). A piece of mi[unknown]lu or alum is put on the child's chest and left there three or four hours until night. The yatiri then rubs the mi[unknown]lu all over the little patient's body, after which he puts the stone into a large bowl of tamata . This is then covered with a [unknown]lih[unknown]la or other woollen cloth and left for twenty minutes to half an hour. When the bowl is uncovered, the mi[unknown]lu is seen to have swelled up like a sponge (from the chemical action), usually into figures which the yatiri is able to study for his diagnosis. Then he says: “This child was frightened at such-and-such a spring,” or “He will get well,” or “He will die.” When the augury is bad, he takes a knife, and cuts the spongy mass with appropriate exorcisms, makes a hole in the ground and buries it. This diagnostic technique is of course especially valuable for the ailments of children, who cannot be expected to verbalize about such abstruse matters with any fluency; the same technique, however, is also used in the case of adult ailments, when the cause of the disease baffles even the yatiri . Finally, urine has a therapeutic value in the apsuyasiña type of counter-witchcraft. In this the house of the sick man is carefully searched and sounded for hollow places with a weavingbatten, and when the place where the sickness is hiding is found, the [unknown]camakani or [unknown]camakiri (other kinds of Aymara medical practitioners) throws some of the sick man's urine on it together with salt, and sometimes with other substances. The sickness then enters the urine and salt, which is then gathered up and thrown into a river, or burnt at a cross-roads, where the next unfortunate passerby will become the “host” of the disease. Best of all is for the [unknown]camakani to obtain by stealth some of the urine of the rival witch who is causing the disease. The sick man is bathed in this urine, which is then thrown surreptitiously outside the witch's door. In this way the witchcraft-induced disease “comes home to roost,” where it belongs.

Diseases and medicines.--Curing is an absorbing interest of the Aymara . Its elaborate development is reflected in the extensive terminology of diseases, medicines, practitioners, and curing techniques. It is recognized that people of different ages are susceptible to special ailments. All adults have some knowledge of simple herbal remedies and treat slight injuries; a doctor is not consulted unless the ailment or injury is persistent and specialized knowledge required.
Diseases are thought to be due mainly to evil spirits and witchcraft, although a few are attributed to natural causes. All the latter are classified as hot or cold and require a remedy of the opposite temperature. These concepts of hot and cold may come from Spanish influence. The general procedure is for the practitioner to divine the cause of disease according to his particular method, and then to cure it by medical or magical techniques.
Beliefs about the cause of disease are numerous. They include seeing ghosts, the soul becoming lost or having been kidnapped by evil spirits or witchee, dreams, being looked at by evil spirits, intrusion of an object into the body, mutilation of one's effigy in witchcraft, and the “evil eye,” the last possibly being a Spanish concept. Most of these have been discussed earlier in connection with witchcraft and supernatural beings. Soul loss, an ailment particularly common among children, results from fright or shock. If the child's mother is unable to make the soul return by calling to it, a doctor makes an image of the child's clothes, entices the soul into it, and places the image in the child's bed (Paredes, 1936, pp. 116-17). The intrusion of a fragment of human bone into the body is the cause of “chullpa sickness,” which comes from witchcraft or malevolent spirits which inhabit ruins. The bone is extracted magically in a variety of ways, but is not removed by sucking.
A great variety of medicines are taken both internally and externally. Most are vegetable, the roots, seeds, leaves, and flowers being taken for specific purposes. One or several plant species may be combined in a given medicine. Remedies of animal derivation, next in importance, include various portions of mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, larvae, insects, starfish, sea urchins, and mollusks. Minerals rank third as medicines, mercury being used to treat syphilis and certain clays to stop internal bleeding. Last in importance ranks human flesh, desiccated bits of which are eaten to cure ghost sickness.

--p
The categories of experience encompassed by the special status designations paqo, yatiri, qolasiri , and the like may best be understood in terms of certain central preoccupations of the Aymara that are cited in an earlier section: (1) concern about disease; (2) concern about the future and the explanation of misfortune; (3) concern about the evil intentions of other human beings. These apprehensions, it was pointed out, are not entirely independent, but instead are intimately linked.
The preoccupation of the Aymara with disease is very striking. Nearly all laymen have considerable specialized medical knowledge and are constantly doctoring themselves for real or imagined ills. 1 In addition, the variety of professional doctors is so considerable that La Barre was led to observe:
... no other primitive group known to modern ethnology has such a rich specialization among practitioners of native medicine. 2
But while this elaboration of specialization has been generally recognized (indeed, it is inescapable), it would appear that etiology of disease according to Aymara theory has been highly over-simplified. Paredes states flatly that “witches” directly, or demons acting at the behest of “witches,” are responsible for all diseases. 3 Taking a similar position, La Barre writes that disease is inevitably caused either by “witchcraft” or by evil spirits. 4 Either [Page [p. 220 b]] these views are over-simple, or the disease theory of the Bolivian Aymara is considerably less complex than is true of the Aymara of Peru. In Chucuito, as has been shown, some diseases are clearly due to sorcery, either directly or indirectly. Others, however, are sent by spirits of their own volition (because they have been angered or slighted), or by permanent and naturally malevolent demons. Still others are contracted from souls and ghosts. Some ailments stem from accidental soul loss, while in others soul kidnapping is the cause. Still others, chullpa sickness, for example, result from the intrusion of a foreign object, either through carelessness or through the evil machinations of humans or demons. In addition, some diseases are unquestionably attributed by the Aymara of Chucuito to natural causes. 5 Among these are various ailments that are (or are thought to be) attendant upon childbirth; fractures, sprains, and dislocations (including the “dislocation” of internal organs); and such common and frequent complaints as p'eqe usu , “headache,” t'uku usu , “common cold,” and [unknown]c'aka usu , “rheumatism.”
Thus the Aymara believe that diseases are attributable to a number of distinct causes, and it is their theory that specialized knowledge and techniques are required to deal effectively with each. When, therefore, disease is approached from the point of view of etiology, it becomes clear that the specialization of Aymara medical practitioners is based primarily upon the nature and “cause” of the illness (real or imaginary) with which they cope, and that the techniques of diagnosis and therapeutics which any particular class of “doctor” employs are, in large part, secondary to this consideration. 6 It is the paqo who cures diseases sent by spirits and demons, or by either at the instigation of a sorcerer. The qolasiri cures [Page [p. 221 a]] diseases due to natural causes, as well as superficial injuries, broken bones, sprains, extracts intruded objects, and treats ghost sickness. The t'aliri specializes in treating dislocations, particularly the “dislocation” of the heart, uterus, or other internal organs. The usuiri administers medicines designed to speed delivery, is a “practical” obstetrician, and treats those diseases, especially aire , to which post-parturient women are thought to be particularly susceptible. 1 Although conclusive data from Chucuito are lacking, the evidence indicates that the laiqa cures, as well as “causes,” some diseases, and practitioners of this class are believed to have the power to cure certain types of paralysis and insanity. 2 Although the yatiri apparently performs no cures and has no special knowledge of remedies, he is consulted frequently in cases of illness in order to ascertain the cause (whether sorcery or otherwise), and is able to divine whether a patient will die or recover.
Viewed from the standpoint of etiology. Aymara medical specialization is rigid; apparently no practitioner feels qualified to step out of his special province to cure diseases due to factors over which he has no control. Thus when Informant 45, himself a paqo , was seized with a stomach ailment ascribed to “natural” causes, he summoned a qolasiri to diagnose his illness and to prescribe the proper remedies. Similarly, Informant 64, a qolasiri , sent a patient who was suffering from a stubborn illness to Informant 109, a paqo , because of his conviction that the disease had been sent by a supernatural being. Informant 66, on the other hand, practiced both as a qolasiri and as a paqo . Further, albeit less formal, specialization within particular branches of native Aymara medicine may be noted. Although both Informants 64 and 65 are classed as qolasiri , the former is noted as a “bone specialist” and for his treatment of sprains and dislocations, while the latter specializes in a particular technique of diagnosis, and in “internal medicine.”

That knowledge is highly valued among the Bororo is substantiated by the fact that the chief of a village is always the most knowledgeable man. Social status and functions are connected with particular lineages and transmitted matrilineally, but the true influential leaders and authorities are the men who excel in knowledge; i.e., they know the myths and songs and their meanings; they know the exact sequence of rituals and the important sacred and secret names of things.

Religious and bureaucratic political leadership demand fundamentally different talents. Whereas the tamoí must be thoroughly knowledgeable of Chiripá life and relations with the supernatural, the cacique must understand the mestizo life-style, language, and goals. The difference is clear in the opposing concepts of marandú and letrado . Letrado literally means “literate,” but connotes a sly self-interest, the capacity to understand the unspoken motives of others and smoothly move for one’s own advantage. Caciques need to be letrado to match the self-interested individuals of mestizo society.
Tamoí and caciques have fundamentally different power bases and thus, [Page 121] fundamentally different roles within community life. While tamoí focus their efforts on the formation and maintenance of the Chiripá community, caciques dominate the community’s relations with external society and the Indian community. The cacique still has little power to act on his own behalf.
The position of political leaders is fundamentally conflicted. On one side, the individuals are closely tied to Chiripá communities through kin relations; on the other, they are representatives of and responsible to mestizo patróns and caudillos. In one classic case, a famous tamoí who asserted himself as both a capatáz and dirigente lost credibility through his associations with mestizos. Indians who knew him in the yerbals remember that “he sold his people” and Cadogan (1959a) wrote that his later attempts to move his community were construed as a capitulation to the government.
Despite the appointment of political officers to manage relations between Guaraní and the larger society, the noncoercive leadership of religious tamoí remains the central focus of Chiripá communities. Appointed political leaders rarely assume a position as caudillos over their communities.

In any case, among the Guaraní too the belief that sicknesses, at least the majority of them, are explained by the bad intentions of knowledgeable persons and bearers of magic resources predominates. Thus the appearance of an epidemic or even of a series of cases of sickness in the same village and in a short space of time can cause important social consequences, generate distrust, misunderstanding, or even open enmities and fights within the local group, putting into action disruptive forces of social life existing in a latent state. It is even possible to state that the mystical sense of solidarity, which, although it does not unite the whole tribe and not always the individuals of a certain horde, makes the populations of the different villages cohesive, rarely suffers dissolution of continuity, except for the atmosphere of insecurity and discontent that dominates all in situations of this nature. 128 This is a supposition made, of course, concerning villages that do not already find themselves in a state of open social disorganization through continuous contact with civilization. After the epidemic is past, there is no delay in re-establishing the normal equilibrium, and the authority of the doctor-sorcerer, who has used the magic and religious resources, or that of the capitão, who has made use of his police authority in order to normalize the situation by fighting the opposing forces, then is subject to considerable increment.
One of the disruptive forces most characteristic of Guaraní society is the constant suspicion of practices of black magic within the group. There is not much exaggeration in the statement that [Page 165] the fear of being the victim of practices of this order is a daily preoccupation of every Guaraní. Some present-day groups reach in this sense, at certain times, a state of profound collective exasperation in which everybody believes himself threatened by everybody, a situation which is explained in large part by the acculturative crisis, and in particular, by the state of “deprivation” and misery, as well as by the deplorable conditions of health in which they live.

It is well known that the phenomenon of cultural disintegration, as the product of interethnic contacts, is manifested, among other things, by the parallel acceptance of two or more solutions for the same problem, of various concommitant elements with the same function, it falling on the individual from case to case to decide in favor of this one or that one. It is in relation to sicknesses and to their treatment that such a state of affairs is revealed with special clarity in Guaraní life. This perhaps primarily because of the focalization, more and more accentuated, that the sickness, real or imaginary, comes to have in the Guaraní mind, undoubtedly in consequence of a psychic flight before an unsatisfactory reality, the fruit of a state of constant frustration. And as the traditional patterns of the culture do not offer elements considered sufficient for facing the problem thus created, there is also recourse to others of foreign derivation. The ideas about the ontology and etiology of the sicknesses, as well as about the methods of cure, thus cease to constitute an integrated whole, but form a conjunction of disparate elements, so to speak. The culture seems to lose one of its primordial functions up to a certain point, that of providing the group and the particular individuals with the resources for sure and satisfactory control over phenomena that go beyond the simple biological reaction. Ideas, beliefs, and explanations of diverse origins, and arising in cultural contexts of different types, strike against one another in the minds of these poor people, producing a mental state 131 of insecurity and sometimes almost of despair. Capitão Bento, former chief of the village of Bananal, suffered from malaria (without, of course, identifying the illness) and thought the ailment was due to physiological disturbances caused in a “natural” manner by some quid malignum , which in some form or other had penetrated his body. His mother settled on the hypothesis of black magic practiced by some personal enemy with the help of a picture that had fallen into his hands. For his part, Samuel, brother of the sick man, was more inclined to believe in the [Page 171] possibility of “some spirit invoked into him,” an idea perhaps of Amerindian origin, but possibly reinforced by contact with the spiritism of the civilized inhabitants of the coast. As it could not fail to be, the same insecurity is observed in the choice of the methods of cure, magico-medicinal as well as religious, and of the specialists, who are either doctor-sorcerers of the same tribe, or civilized “curers,” or even doctors possessing an official diploma.
The quid malignum cause of the sickness may be any foreign body or poisonous substance or of another form harmful to health, such as pebbles, seeds, ugly worms, or even fire. If in fact it has entered the body as a consequence of black magic, the doctor-sorcerer does not get to do anything about it until he discovers the one responsible, so as to attack him with countersorcery. This among the Kayová at least. If, however, the quid malignum entered the body in a natural way, i.e., without there being any unconfessable purposes on the part of ill-intentioned individuals, whether it be by carelessness, by the unfortunate conjunction of adverse circumstances, or by the manifestation of certain deities whose appearance is linked with certain times of the year, the removal can be made either by the technique of the doctor-sorcerer, by the use of appropriate medicines, by means of practices performed by the patient himself, or, finally, with the help of religious ceremonies.
The attitude of the present-day Guaraní, particularly that of the Ñandéva of the coastal villages, toward sicknesses and death is characterized by a peculiar combination of fatalism and -- though we say it with due reserve -- Christian resignation. Capitão Bento’s daughter was ill; her father took her to Dr. Militão, a physician of São Vicente or Santos, who prescribed a series of remedies for her. But in the end the child died. “It is because she had to die,” was Bento’s simple explanation. And Bento’s mother added: “When a person has to die, treatment is not worth anything; when a person does not have to die, Ñandedjára himself carries the person through. When it is [Page 172] not the will of God, neither doctor nor curer can turn it around.” 132 Highly illuminating words, as they make it very clear that what predominates is not the magical attitude, but the religious one. In the treatment of the sick, the efficiency of the magical and medicinal resources is only conditional -- which divests magic of one of its essential characteristics, namely, natural causality. When the late doctor-sorcerer Arnaldo -- I was told -- saw that a sick child “had a cure,” he gave it a remedy and it became healthy. But when he saw that nothing could be done, he said so at once; he ordered herb tea to be prepared, but he did not have any hope. Fiat voluntas tua /Thy will be done/.
It is seen, therefore, that the power of the doctor-sorcerer is subject to considerable limitation, stemming from divine will. Were it not for this, he himself would not get sick and would not die. On the contrary, the Ñandéva says, his supernatural faculties can easily become his misfortune, because to be the bearer of extraordinary magical powers and knowledge is a dangerous state. If the doctor-sorcerer to whom the auxiliary spirit communicated the prayer or magico-medicinal song does not live in accordance with the prescriptions tied to them, he himself becomes the cause of his death. It happens that he dies only two or three months after the descent of the protector spirit, “because the religion of the Indians is very strong and also very fine,” according to the words of João Samuel. This is why Arnaldo died.

Craft specialization among men includes the manufacture of strainer-winnowing trays and of women’s back baskets with tumplines, to cite only the more common and important ones. The making of strainer-winnowing trays is not an industry which is dying, and its practitioners are not, therefore, simply fewer and fewer. The need for this item of domestic equipment has continued among the Cayuá themselves, and its use has developed among local Neo-Brazilians, who do not manufacture their own trays. Specialization is nevertheless present, for some Cayuá in 1943 indicated that they always obtained their winnowing trays from certain others who were quite good at making them. 131
One of the most important uses of these utensils as strainers is in connection with cãwĩ’ which is usually strained of all the larger lumps of corn or other substance which may occur in it as it is served.
It cannot be flatly denied, of course, since documentary evidence is lacking, that craft specialization of the present sort existed formerly. But at least one point seems to indicate the opposite: informants who were asked about whether or not they were able to make certain things usually indicated that they felt they should be able to make them, even in cases where they confessed they were not.

In all three tribes the men who are specialists in the interpretation, transmission, and execution of religious principles, are designated by the term máma and generally they are old men who have spent many years of apprenticeship at the side of a specialist of high reputation. These men are not shamans or curers, but constitute a class of tribal priests who are highly respected. The mámas of the Kogi enjoy very high prestige all over the Sierra Nevada because they are said to have a very profound knowledge of the tribal traditions and, in particular, of the rituals which are necessary to guarantee the order of the universe. Thanks to the mámas of the Kogi the sun follows his daily round; the seasons change in an orderly fashion, and the great principle of fertility, central to all religious thought, continues to manifest itself in nature as well as in all living creatures. The mámas celebrate the various rituals of the individual’s life cycle, and also officiate at the collective ceremonials, the dances, offerings, and other occasions.

In order to take the soul out of the body and send it on a supernatural mission, the witch doctors inhale up their noses a powder made with roasted grains of sebil (Piptadenia sp.) to which they sometimes add powdered tobacco. These inhalations cause them to become dazed 16 and then it is that the witch doctor's soul abandons his body and turns into an insect or a bird--usually the yulo --and goes off to alight on a tree which stands in the middle of a lake. This tree is perpetually shaking and it is extremely difficult to stay on it. A grave misfortune overtakes those who fall for they are immediately devoured by the palometas [“pirañas” - a laterally flattened, ferocious, small fish - Translator] and crocodiles which swam in the lake. If the witch doctors are expert in their art they change themselves into lizards and so manage to stay on the tree. It is supposed that each witch doctor owns a branch of that tree which is closely allied with his destiny. While the leaves remain green the witch doctor enjoys good health and is in no danger but as soon as the branch starts to wither then his troubles begin.
The witch doctors can predict good and bad weather for a long time in advance, for on their journeyings they see the green and dry leaves corresponding to the good and bad seasons of the year.
The witch doctors have, also, the power of turning themselves into animals or fire that licks up the underbrush in their path.
In order to overcome diseases, the witch doctors make use of small wands which the spirits have given them; they use also the wings of several birds ( yulo , carancho ).
Animals as well as men can be treated by the witch doctors. An informant described to me the treatment which was given to a horse. The witch doctor first recited an enchantment and then applied suction to the horse's rump until he was able to extract a small piece of wood which he said was the cause of the malady.
Some witch doctors are extremely dangerous. They start by devouring dogs and then go on to attack men. It is almost impossible to put an end to their criminal career for they revive if they are killed and if they are burned to death they will still return.
Some women can become witch doctors, although they enjoy far less prestige than do the man. Their vocation is made apparent by the following signs: they spend hours on end crouched over the ground, continually swaying back and forth, finally they make an attempt to flee into the underbrush and their strength is such that several men cannot restrain them. Once off in the bush, they tear off their 17 clothes and climb a tree, where they remain for several days swaying and singing.
