Knowledge of the higher and especially of the intermediate genealogy, can be a form of power. It would be more accurate to say that only the powerful are allowed to have the knowledge. It is considered very presumptuous for an unimportant man to talk of the higher and intermediate levels of a genealogical charter except to give his own descent line. This became very clear during an interview with an old man who is considered one of the two greatest experts on genealogy of Zä S[unknown]llase in Däräqe Maryam.
The old nobleman, whose homestead is 40 kilometers from Däräqe Maryam, does not actually remember as much of the genealogy of Zä S[unknown]llase as younger experts who live nearer Däräqe, in fact he is becoming senile. During an interview, the 83-year-old aristocrat at first denied that he knew anything about Zä S[unknown]llase. When he was told the first few generations as recorded from other informants, he shook with rage and demanded truculently to know who had been telling about his forefathers. After his anger subsided, the old expert demonstrated his famed virtuosity by inserting a non-functional (for Däräqe Maryam) ancestor between a second and previously third generational major sub-house.
No single person knows or thinks he knows more than a small part of the genealogy of a maximal house. Besides the unequal distribution of knowledge about the intermediate levels of the charter, there is unequal distribution, in another sense, of knowledge about the lowest three or four generations, inasmuch as each active member usually knows more about his descent line’s collateral genealogy than any other active member.
An example of both types of differentially distributed knowledge is given in Figure 13, which shows the knowledge which two men have about the sub-house of Marta in the maximal house of Wädajo. The first informant, an unimportant core member (No. 5 on Fig. 10), telescoped the charter by omitting two generational levels below Marta, and thereby making her great grandchildren her children. The second informant, who is an active open group member through his wife, included these intermediate levels. The expert knows more collateral genealogy around his wife’s descent line than the unimportant man did around his, but the expert does not know the unimportant man’s part of the charter.
The incomplete and differential distribution of knowledge about the maximal house’s genealogical charter leads to a certain amount of indeterminancy with regard to the active membership in a descent group. It is almost impossible to determine the exact number of open group active members of a descent group. Aside from methodological problems, which are great, there is a more fundamental difficulty. The men who use the land in a primary land division do not always fully agree upon each [Page 152] other’s status. While public agreement on most members’ legitimacy as r[unknown]st holders is maintained, individuals hold their private opinions.

The attitudes of civilian Amhara toward the sh[unknown]ifta combine fear and dislike with a strong tendency toward idealization. The sh[unknown]ifta is feared because he is a killer; if a person happens to witness him performing some act of theft or murder, he will usually keep quiet about it for fear of reprisal. He is disliked because he lives parasitically off the productive activities of others. But the sh[unknown]ifta is widely admired, on the other hand, because he possesses a number of qualities that are dear to the Amhara. He is reputed to be an expert singer of sh[unknown]illala . He is credited with unusually handsome features because, living at the expense of others as he does, he has plenty to eat and no arduous work to wear him down. Above all he is guabaz, the great Amhara virtue that embodies bravery, fierceness, hardihood, and general male competence. This is symbolized by the sh[unknown]ifta ’s letting his hair grow to the proportions of a gofare, the wildly thick hair style of the warrior.
The Amhara’s admiration for the sh[unknown]ifta is reminiscent of American attitudes toward the outlaw in “western” films. In the Amhara case, however, this is not balanced by a corresponding idealization of a sheriff-figure as the representative of civil order. Although a feudal lord or governor who captures some sh[unknown]ifta in his area may be admired, this admiration will be directed to his personal qualities of bravery or cunning far more than to his capacity as an agent of “law and order.” There is no feeling among the Amhara that the sh[unknown]ifta must be captured simply because he is an outlaw. Instead, a more pragmatic approach is taken: the sh[unknown]ifta is acknowledged as a legitimate social type and is tolerated at a distance so long as his killing does not become wanton or excessive. This approach, and what, in the idealization of the sh[unknown]ifta, appears to be a tendency to identify with someone who openly flaunts the norms of civil society, bespeaks a relatively weak commitment to the value of civil order.

The Bushbuck Clan were the first iron-workers, and they found their ironstone on the borders of Koki and western Budu. The stone was found on the surface, and as there was usually sufficient for their needs on the surface, they seldom dug more than three or four feet for it...A goat-skin with a stick attached to it was tied over the mouth of each pot, and a man stood between the two pots [Page 381] and raised the sticks up and down, so as to draw the air in by the nozzle, and by the downward movement to force it out again into the pipe at the end of the nozzle by which it was carried into the furnace. With a little practice the man who worked the bellows became quite expert in keeping up a continuous blast. After the preparations had been made, the chief smith lighted the fire at the bottom of the furnace through one of the blast-holes, and the blast was started all round; it had then to be kept going until the whole of the stone was melted.

In urban contexts it happens that relatives living abroad are asked to bring home medicine even if the same medicine is locally available. In pharmacies, one finds that sometimes the medicine is presented to the customer by reference to its country of origin rather than by reference to its name. A pharmacist in Baydhabo told me that if the medicine is accompanied by an instruction sheet in some foreign language, preferably Italian, this may be a decisive factor in helping a customer to make up his mind. I also found that some of the free-lance dakhtars who had a knowledge of Italian had a large practice despite the fact that they charged considerably more than the clinics.
When asked why they regard foreign medicine and medical expertise in this favourable way people tended to refer to particular events when the efficacy ( faa’ido ) of foreign medicine had been observed. One such event had been during the campaign against smallpox. Another common answer was that gaalo (foreigners who are not Muslims), have been given all the knowledge of “this world” ( adduunyo ). Their supreme knowledge is manifested not only in the field of medicine but also by aeroplanes, cars etc. Somalis, and Muslims generally, have instead been given the knowledge of “the next world” ( aakhiro ). While gaalo lead easy lives now, Muslims will get their pleasure on the day of judgement ( qiyaame ).
Although foreigners are potential carriers of important resources, this does not make them into an unambiguously positive category. Rather, a gaal represents the epitome of the category of shisheeye, those strangers who must be kept under a suspicious guard, and with whom interaction should be avoided. 8 The intentions of foreigners are unfathomable. Their impredictability is expressed in the proverb caqli gaal iyo indho quraanyo midna lama arko, “one cannot see the eyes of ants nor what is in the mind of infidels” (Kapchits 1983:86, quoted by Andrzejewski 1986:421).
Summing up, foreigners and their medical knowledge are defined as [Page 116] a category distinctly opposed to the known and normal. We have previously seen similar attitudes concerning both herbalists and religious healers.

When two lovers of one woman claimed to be the genitor of her child, the Saa-Katengo Kuta decided to wait until the child was old enough to show resemblances to its genitor before deciding. Since Lozi technology is comparatively simple, the kuta rarely calls for ‘expert evidence’. Most judges--and indeed most Lozi--have some knowledge of all Lozi customs, of technological actions, and of general and specialized activities such as leechcraft. Furthermore, there is no requirement that facts involved indirectly in a case should be proved, nor is there any fiction of judicial ignorance. Various judges know also the customs and practices of other tribes, and inform their fellows of these. Here, however, the kuta may call for someone to tell it what these other tribal rules are. Otherwise, there are only two situations in which I have heard the kuta ask for expert evidence. One situation is where they refer to Government doctors for an opinion on the extent of injuries. The other situation is in adultery or divorce or seduction cases, where it is alleged that one person has infected another with venereal disease--an action on which damages and a fine were imposed in 1946. Here too the parties are referred to the hospital for examination. The doctor's, or even the African Hospital Orderly's, evidence is accepted as final, and there is no questioning on it.

The attempt to isolate ‘law’ from the rest of the social process is only one of a series of similar problems to which the same general rule can be applied: as society becomes increasingly differentiated, so different social processes will become increasingly distinguished. Let us take for example the long-standing controversy over the distinction between religion and magic. In the totemic ceremonies of the comparatively undifferentiated Australian tribes, there are elements which by commonsense application of our words we may call ‘magical’ and ‘religious’. Yet the ceremonies as a whole have to be considered magicoreligious. But in as politically developed societies as those of most South and Central African Bantu (such as the Lozi), there [Page 266] are priests of the ancestral-cult and there are other persons who attempt to achieve specific ends by means of medicinal substances whose operation cannot be observed. We cannot help but call these ‘magicians’. 1 The priests occupy their offices by virtue of their positions in kinship groups; they perform prescribed actions and utter certain formulae, at set times and places, with certain material objects. The magicians may be hereditary specialists but they work outside their kinship groups; they perform other actions and utter other formulae, at other times and places, with other material objects. Priests and magicians act largely in different ranges of social relations. Here magic and religion are institutionally distinct, though both may be used and intermingled in certain ceremonies. Their elements, which we detect clearly at this stage, can be traced in less differentiated societies, and it is possible to analyse their relations with one another. So it is with law. In a society as politically advanced as that of the Lozi, we find law clearly exhibited as a body of rules and a set of judgments, and we can examine how custom, morality, and religion form sources of law in both these senses. It is reasonable to assume that a similar analysis can be applied to less developed societies. Clearly these have ‘law’ both as a body of rules defining the appropriate behaviour between persons, and as judgments, acceptable to normal members of the society, in which these rules are applied to situations of dispute. The question of sanctions--of how these judgments are enforced--is a different problem, one in the field of what we call politics, rather than in the field of jurisprudence. Law as a corpus juris exists without enforcement. No Lozi describing to me the period of political change when Lozi kutas were lax in enforcing their judgments, spoke as if he considered it a period of ‘no law’.

Blood-letting is a common practice and is usually done with a horn ( mulumeha ) or similarly shaped gourd (Fig. 20(e)). The mouth of the horn is placed over the incision and a vacuum created by the doctor sucking through the peak. To seal the vacuum, he closes the small hole in the peak with beeswax, using his tongue and teeth. The outside of the peak is liberally smeared with beeswax to facilltate this. To break the vacuum, the seal is pierced with a grass stalk and the congealed blood contained in the horn poured off into a dish. Two or three horns may be employed, either in succession or at the [Page 69] same time, and the amount of blood-letting depends on the doctor's decision and perhaps the client's patience, cupping horns are also employed without reference to an ng'aka or even to a lay specialist, in much the same way as aspirins are employed in an European household.

The most menacing Dogon deity is Nòmò, the water god. Feared as no other being, he does not command a great deal of ritual attention but is the main inspiration for some ritual specialists in Dogon, the shamanic priests [ binukèju]. He too is a capricious god, ever changing his appearance and eager to trap people in the water. The fear of drowning is great in Dogon society, astonishingly so when one considers the dry Sahelian climate and the virtual absence of water during most of the year. Still, Nòmò and his familiars, like the crocodile, the sheath-fish, and water serpents command a deep respect. There is no known protection against this threatening side of Nòmò, but some small offerings are made to make him release his prey. Larger sacrifices and offerings are made by his people, the shamanistic priests.

Still another area which was used as a measure of acculturation concerns treatment of disease and attitudes towards Western medicine. This area is closely linked to that of religious attitudes and behavior. There are two types of traditional Kanuri medical specialists. One is a secular specialist who deals with a restricted number of physical ailments: muscular pains, swellings, broken bones. The other is the Koranic Malam who writes out verses of the Koran on a wooden board. Particular verses are used to treat specific diseases--the verse is chosen to fit the ailment. The ink is then washed off the board and drunk as a cure by the ailing person. This cure is called alo . Between these two medical specialists the Kanuri have a great many cures for a wide variety of diseases. When asked whether they would go to a European doctor for treatment (Table XXVI), most people replied that they would go. Only seven individuals stated that they would not do so. Two of these are Koranic Malams, whose own roles in this area conflict directly with the Western medical practitioner; three are members of the Low-status group. The direct effect of the presence of the anthropologist as an agent of Western culture who cannot avoid distributing aspirins and other pills is seen in the response of an elderly kabuna who stated that he would go for treatment because the anthropologist had come to Geidam, but would not otherwise have gone.

means of treatment while for three others Kanuri treatment was not particularly successful when compared with Western types of treatment. The Kanuri feel that their traditional means of treating broken bones, bites by poisonous snakes, and jaundice (called “yellow-eye”) are effective, and this is reflected in their answers in columns 1, 2 and 3 of Table XXVII. 86 per cent stated that the Kanuri specialist was more effective in setting bones; 60 per cent said that he was more effective in treating jaundice; 89 per cent said he was more effective with snake-bite wounds. With respect to headaches, to smallpox ( baru ), and to a general complaint of internal pains ( tuno ), Kanuri treatment is not as effective. As can be seen in columns 4, 5, and 6, belief in the effectiveness of Kanuri treatment for these ailments is low: 12 per cent state that the Kanuri cure for headaches is the more effective; 19 per cent state that they believe the Kanuri cure for smallpox to be more effective; 37 per cent state that the Kanuri cure for tuno is the more effective. The expectation that for the first three ailments the Kanuri respondents would claim that Kanuri cures are more effective while for the latter three ailments they would indicate a greater reliance in the effectiveness of Western medicine was upheld.

The spirits of good and evil are thought of as coming and going on water, and so all akombo for the expulsion of evil consist of acts, in which evil is thrown away into the water in the form of a scapegoat to flow away, and an act symbolic of virtue coming on the water is performed. The akombo practised to expel evils present in the form of sicknesses, besides the various akombo already mentioned, are illustrations of this.
The akombo practised for the various sicknesses such as the ‘akombo imandi’ for leprosy, the ‘akombo agashi’ for skin diseases, the ‘akombo wayo’ for septic wounds are all performed in the same way. The practitioner of the akombo and the householder in which the sickness has appeared, proceed to a stream. The householder takes up his position up stream, and the practitioner takes a black cock and touches the householder on’ the chest and back with it, and twirls it round his head six times. Then bending down he splashes the water away from the householder with the black cock, saying ‘ibo sen, ibo sen’ (evil flow away, evil flow away); then he breaks the toes of the black cock and throws it away to flow away on the water. Then he takes a white cock, and splashes water with it towards the householder saying ‘isho kondo, isho kondo’ (virtue come virtue come); and then he takes the white cock home with him.
The common ceremony of ihambe i fan, which consists of the simple act of sipping water and spewing it out, symbolic of the cleansing of the heart from evil, is another ceremony in which the water is used as a cleansing element, and this is performed in the taking of all oaths.”

Another curative method which deserves a few words is the acupuncture. For Korean doctors, this consists in piercing various points of the body with a lancet so as to restore the machine's natural equilibrium. There are special treatises devoted to this part of the art of surgery, the only one known to the Koreans. They even know how to fabricate models of the numan body with iron wire so as to show students the exact places where [CLXXXII] the lancet must be inserted. Under the hand of a skilled practitioner this instrument, which is exceedingly fine, may penetrate four or five centimeters deep, and scarcely any blood is lost. Missionaries asse[unknown] t that they have often seen remarkable effects, which are always very prompt, from this sort of treatment.

Because geomantic theory is so complex and difficult to learn, locating auspicious grave sites is a professional specialization in both Korea and China. And because the professional geomancer’s knowledge comes from books and is supposedly acquired through laborious study, it earns him the respect of his clients. Shamans ( mudang ) and other religious specialists do not enjoy such esteem in either society (cf. Freedman 1966: 124). This connection between prestige and absence of volitional intervention relates to an argument that we develop more fully below. As we shall see, the conception of ancestors as dependent and passive beings is evident in prestigious and formal ancestor worship. The view of ancestors as active and potentially hostile is more closely related to the shamanistic belief system, which is socially disapproved.
Some Twis[unknown]ongdwi villagers have a rudimentary knowledge of geomantic theory. Kw[unknown]on Hae-su, for example, knew that the accumulation of water below a site indicated its auspiciousness (Yoon Hong-key 1976: 48-51; Feuchtwang 1974b: 134); but no one in Twis[unknown]ongdwi is expert in such matters. When villagers need a geomancer, they hire one from outside the community and trust his judgment.
Villagers’ accounts of geomancy differ from the professional’s manuals in one respect: the villagers place greater emphasis on the misfortunes than on the benefits of geomancy. The recent prosperity of one lineage family was universally attributed to the grave of the household head’s first wife, and the grave of Kw[unknown]on Po was credited with the numerousness of his descendants; but poverty and lack of descendants were far more common in the accounts of geomancy we obtained. Apparently this is one reason why Twis[unknown]ongdwi villagers usually bury parents together. Placing them in separate graves would increase the chance of obtaining geomantic benefit, as Freedman (1966: 131) and Ahern (1973: 186) suggest, but it would also increase the risk of suffering misfortune.
Although Twis[unknown]ongdwi residents seem more concerned with misfortunes than benefits, and although they lack the specialist’s familiarity with the intricacies of geomantic theory, their view of geomantic causality is fundamentally the same as that found in the Chinese and Korean geomantic manuals. We did not find, as did Emily Ahern (1973: 175-90) in a Taiwanese village, that the belief in ancestral discomfort and consequent intervention in the lives of descendants was a substitute for the belief in the mechanistic, impersonal effects of grave locations. In Twis[unknown]ongdwi, informants were equally comfortable with both ideas.
Like the professional geomancer, for example, Twis[unknown]ongdwi villagers know that the corpse must be laid in precisely the right spot if it is to convey geomantic benefits (Yoon Hong-key 1976: 60-62). A small difference can drastically alter, for better or worse, the consequences of a site. One lineage member explained that his grandfather did not deliberately make him ill, but that the precise location (as well as the timing) of his grandfather’s [Page 74] reburial caused the accident that left him with a debilitating illness. Had the corpse been buried a few paces downhill, our informant noted, he would not have suffered his misfortune. The wife of another lineage member, whose descent line seems headed for extinction, told us that “fate” could keep the geomantic benefits of a site from the descendants by causing the corpse to be laid slightly off the correct spot. Her family had moved the grave of one of its ancestors several times in the hope that a new location would enable one of her married sons to produce children.

There is a set of cultural values specifying which tasks are appropriate for experts and which are not. The community members exert social pressure on an individual who does a task customarily reserved for a specialist. He is said to be “breaking someone's rice bowl” (see Glossary C). The statement illustrates a basic understanding of the total system. A man earns his rice 4 by exchanging an activity and if someone else performs that activity in his place, he will go hungry. If too many people did not hire specialists, the specialists could not purchase food, and the whole system would break down. This was about the manner that several village men were able to extend the meaning of the quoted phrase.
I learned the extent of social pressure on transgressors the week we moved into the village. I nailed some screening over five windows in our house and this shocked many villagers. Very politely, at least a dozen [Page 148] men (not in a group) told me that Kao Mu-li in the next village was very good at that kind of work, if he was employed the job would last longer, and right now he was not busy. I immediately hired him to build my screen door and paid above standard rates for the job to make up for my inadvertent error. This price soon became common knowledge throughout the area.
Other similar examples were witnessed. The village barber, Liao An-pei, was seeking a wife and during our stay, built a new house with one of its rooms designated for his shop. As the building neared completion, he believed he had spent too much money. Although he had hired a painter to put one coat of paint on the woodwork, he considered doing the second coat himself to save money. Since he had never painted before, he picked up a brush while the painter was putting on the first coat and painted a window sill. Everyone in the shop laughed at him and called others to come and see Liao An-pei painting. For days afterwards, although I could detect no difference in the comparative quality of the workmanship, visitors were shown the window-sill that Liao An-pei painted. This always brought a smile and often, an additional comical remark. Liao An-pei decided to omit the second coat until after he saved more money. He explained that business men had to be extra careful. Since almost every man in the village was his customer, if they got angry, he would lose [Page 149] business. He also explained that every villager had his haircuts in a barber shop and not at home. If a man was poor, he just got haircuts less often. Although Liao An-pei had a standard price, he did cut the hair of some village indigents at a discount or even free and no one seemingly abused the privilege. This kind of contribution was common in the village for the community was in some ways like a kinship group who took care of its own members when they needed help.
The occupations in Taiwan which are restricted to specialists are equivalent to those termed professions or trades in America. The trades include repairmen and the various building occupations such as painter, carpenter, mason, roofer, or plumber. In America, even when these are restricted, many householders will perform these tasks in their own homes. Government agencies have even institutionalized the practice by issuing “Homeowner's Permits” which allow an individual to do restricted work on his own home although it requires a registered tradesman such as a journeyman or master plumber to do the same job in any other home than his own. The typical American does more of these “do-it-yourself” activities in his own home than the typical Sanlei villager. There is one regular exception: the householder may help his hired specialist. For many tasks, I could detect no difference in the quality of the work of the expert in contrast to that of the homeowner. [Page 150] I never observed any major job without at least one hired expert although on two occasions, there were more householders than experts on a single job: when the mayor and his son helped one expert replaster a mudbrick house; and when Liao Chin-ping (one of the village miners), his younger brother, and his son helped two roofers put a new tile roof on his house.

One significant type of practice involves specialists in feng shui (literally wind and water but usually termed geomancy). Geomancy is related to the Yin (negative) and Yang (positive) factors and the Five Elements: water, metal, fire, earth, and wood (Burkhardt, 1953:129-33). “Geomancy deals with the supernatural relation of geographical locations to human events” (C. K. Yang, 1967b:263). Certain geographical locations have influence on human life, negative or positive. These factors are especially important with regard to the location of tombs, building sites, and the kitchen stove. Almost all village adults are amateur geomancers, i.e., they possess rudimentary knowledge of significant elements. Moreover, villagers believe they can generalize from previous events. For instance, a house may be built right next door to a geomancer-directed house without professional consultation [Page 388] by duplicating the orientation. Since there are family burial plots, geomancers are not always used for additional burials.
The most frequent call for a geomancer to come to Sanlei is to orient the kitchen stove. Sanlei villagers usually consult a geomancer from Pouti but occasionally employ a more expensive one from Hsin Tien. Although the literature mentions relocation of ancestral graves if a family has great misfortune, this has not happened in Sanlei but about twenty years ago, one family removed a rock near a tomb and planted three trees as directed by a geomancer who was called as a consultant after much misfortune.
As previously stated, Talei Li has many excellent sites for tombs with powerful feng shui coordinates. Two of the most famous geomancers in Taipei have purchased many of these sites. They then select them for clients and also sell the sites to the clients and make a profit both on the sale and as a consultant.

Again, as in the case of the other three lineages, the Uis' views about the te-li of the settlement provide important clues about the nature of the group. What is interesting here, however, is not so much people's statements about their te-li as the steps they have taken to improve it. The Uis say that theirs is the te-li of the lion, and that their hall is positioned precisely right to benefit from this te-li . Yet pleased as most of them seem to be with their lot, during the winter of 1970 there were several conferences between the lineage managers and an expert on te-li from Taipei. He assured them that if they built a wall to enclose the courtyard in front of the hall, their te-li would be even better. The primary result would be that all the wealth and prestige attained by the Uis [Page 61] would be held in the group and would not flow out to other people: “As the teeth in the mouth hold in the saliva, so the wall and gate in front of the settlement will hold in our riches and good fortune and not let them escape.” Acting on this advice, the Uis used surplus funds from the corporate lands to build a high brick wall and gate across the front of the settlement. In this instance, as in others, the Uis found it very important that they were in a position to pay for this lineage project with money earned by the corporate lands. They felt that if an assessment had to be made from every household, the project would be an agglomeration of separate elements, rather than an unambiguously corporate enterprise. They always spoke of the wall (and of other settlement projects, such as the water pump and tower) as having come from the ancestors; that is, they were financed out of the proceeds from land that had been set aside as corporate property by the ancestors.

A second consideration [for building a dwelling] in selecting the site is the content of the soil. Rangama residents take soil samples to the astrological specialist (usually to the astrologer) who examines them from the point of view of their color, texture and taste. He then determines whether the soil can be considered auspicious or inauspicious. There are numerous prescriptions about soil content and color in the textual material available to the astrologer. Some prescriptions of this nature are given in the appended Mayimataya . Lay knowledge about these matters is not very elaborate. One notion which appears to have achieved some currency, however, is that high iron ore content is inauspicious. The astrologer can presumably determine whether it is too high by tasting the soil. If the first soil sample is not satisfactory, additional samples from other parts of the site are examined...The calculation of an auspicious orientation for the dwelling is a task which is undertaken by the astrologer or by another astrological specialist. Laymen lack the knowledge to make these calculations, although it is widely believed that orienting a dwelling toward the north is not auspicious whatever the astrological conditions. With the exception of the schoolmaster’s bungalow, no village dwellings are oriented toward the north. It is also widely believed that dwellings should not be oriented directly onto lanes of traffic. An orientation for maximum privacy is functional from the point of view of beliefs in projective phenomena such as ‘evil eye’ which have been discussed briefly in part 1 of this chapter. Further details on the influence of projective phenomena in the design of the dwelling will appear at the end of this section. There are, in addition, textual prescriptions for such orientations.

Individual reaction to the monk's extension of his traditional role varies greatly both within and between the lay and the religious sections of society. Some people consider it most unsuitable that the bhikkhus should be actively involved in the practical affairs of the lay world, especially when the activities in question have overt political implications, as is the case with the community development projects in deprived, and therefore potentially disaffected areas. An alliance of this nature between the government and the Sangha was felt by these people to be to the credit of neither party. Some more cynical and perhaps more realistic observers view the desacralizing of the monk's role as a sine qua non of his retaining any kind of function in modern Thai society, which they see as becoming increasingly secularized [Page 85] and where many attributes of the monkly role have already been taken over by specialists. The choice presented to the monk would appear to be that of losing any real social function whilst maintaining a semi-divine status, or of increasing his involvement with the lay world at the cost of diminishing his special prestige.

Ideally, a house should therefore be built with the high levels of the floor on the east, and the low areas on the western side. The [Page 162] stairway should lead to the low area but not be directed towards the west. In practice most houses are not built strictly according to the east-west axis, and deviations of up to 45 degrees to either side are common. The exact position of the home often depends on the advice of a ritual specialist who will take the topographical circumstances into account before deciding upon the direction of the house. Building along a north-south axis is generally avoided in rural regions, as it would ‘offend the sun’....If a man who wishes to build a house can ill afford the services of an astrologer, he decides for himself the exact location of the new home. At the selected spot he traces out a rectangle of the size of the floor of the future house, taking care to avoid planning the main axis of the house in an inauspicious direction. The rectangle is cleared of all growth, and great care is taken to level out the building site, and to remove all tree trunks, stones, pieces of glass and other impurities. It is believed that any such impurity interferes with the happiness of the inhabitants of the future house. When the site has been well prepared, the owner often engages a ritual specialist, either layman or monk, to pacify the spirits who may be disturbed by the building process. If the specialist is a monk, the ceremony consists simply of a profuse sprinkling of the site with sacral water whilst uttering auspicious P[unavailable]li words. However, if the specialist is a layman, a placatory gift is made. The lay ritual specialist can sprinkle the site with some sacral water, and place incense, candles, flowers and some foods on the [Page 163] earth, whilst invoking the different powers to allow the building of the home to take place....After the invocation he sprinkles sacral water on the building site, and scatters some puffed rice, green peas and sesame seed. For a period of about a quarter of an hour all ceremonial action stops in order to give the invoked powers the opportunity to enjoy the different gifts. When the specialist is of the opinion that sufficient time has elapsed, he removes the receptacles with the gifts for Phajaanâag and indicates where the first hole should be dug, and in which direction the soil should be thrown. For the decision where this first hole ought to be, he has to find out the exact position of the great serpent ( nâag). He may have to consult a handbook or private notes inherited from his teacher to determine the serpent's position.

The Toradja are powerless against leprous wounds. Among the remedies that are used for them are the leaves of the patimoele , an herb with little purple flowers, which are warmed and then placed on the joints. Many come to us for help with these wounds. There are also some Mohammedans from the coast who have the reputation of being able to cure this sickness. They use for this a dried tuberous plant that is imported by Chinese traders and is therefore called kasina or kajoe sina , “Chinese wood.” These tubers are cut into pieces and cooked, and the patient drinks this water incessantly; several times a day he holds his wounds in the steam of the boiling; scrapings of the tuber are also applied to the wounds. An important prescription, however, is that the patient is to bathe at least three times a day in clear running water. An [Page 285] analysis of the above-named tuberous plant has shown that its effective constituent is tannin, but this is present in such a minute quantity that not much power can come from it. 
During this treatment the patient must live in a little hut, secluded from the people. He may not receive visitors; he (she) may not even see persons of the opposite sex. Furthermore, he must abstain from many foods, the most important of which have already been named.
Another reason why the Toradja are set on the treatment with kajoe sina by a Mohammedan is because he /197/ combines with his work all sorts of mysterious things, which are impressive. With great ostentation the medical expert pronounces a magic formula ( do’a ) over the pot, and if the sick person recovers, then he ascribes this more to the power of this formula than to the effect of the medicine. Indeed, good results have been obtained from this treatment.

Yet this common knowledge of pedigrees is notably surpassed by that of priests and go-betweens in every Ifugao community, and among these there are a few expert genealogists who can recite interminable series of names with a speed and assurance which gives the impression that their unending enumerations of pedigrees are but utterances of names and more names, without any attempt to interconnect or to classify. However, further inquiry shows that each of these names has its well determined place in the genealogical trees that exist in their heads. Each represents a particular person of the past, who was the husband or wife [Page 360] of this or that person, the father, the grandfather, the great grandfather of these or those sons or daughters, grandsons, great grandsons... and so forth down to the present generation.
Furthermore, their knowledge is not confined to bare names of persons; it is associated accurately with the localities where the cited persons lived or whence they came, as well as with the latter’s social noteworthy deeds and standing. So complete is their store of facts that they can duplicate their enumeration with a long series of names of priests and go-betweens, tell what rice fields a particular person owned and in what site these lay, point out who among the ancestors made a new terrace, purchased or sold a rice field, or organized a head hunting expedition. In a word, the experts can give any information that may be of interest or use in the Ifugao community in which they are living.
Nor is their knowledge of pedigrees fragmentary, at least not predominantly so; for they know not only ancestors who belong to three or four particular lines of ascendance, but also almost all side lines, as long as one or another branch did not emigrate to some other locality. Such achievement is explained by the fact that in the mind of the expert, genealogies really begin with the beginning, that is, the starting point is a certain ancestor, say of the tenth generation of the past, and from this ancestor and his wife they descend through a hundred and more side lines and bifurcations to the present generation. It is easy therefore to understand that a few such pedigrees, if combined, are an almost complete census of the population.
How do the Ifugaos acquire that knowledge? When priests and go-betweens are being initiated by their father, grandfather, uncle or grand uncle, as the case may be, pedigrees together with all other information connected with the very names of the ancestors are taught “ex professo”, through methodical repetition. There is a good chance that an expert genealogist will form another expert, who may even surpass his master, as long as he cares to learn additional pedigrees from other specialists. Priests and go-betweens, whenever they exercise their functions, constantly keep the pedigrees fresh in their memory.... 
Since the names of the ancestors of the first class, those who are termed “ancestors of the other side”, cannot be the same for all households, since, moreover, there are but a few priests, expert genealogists, it is necessary that those in whose behalf the sacrifice is offered inform the actual performer about the names of their ancestors or at least about the names of those who head the various lines of descent. Consequently all households must know their pedigrees, or if actually they don’t know, because they are rather young, they have to call one of their relatives who knows and who can inform the priest. Should they not do so, should they allow the priest to go on with the rites notwithstanding the fact that his initial invocation of ancestors was defective on account of lack of information, they would surely displease those among the ancestors they did not call, who afterwards, as they believe, may take their revenge by causing illness or death....
Expert genealogists are called to decide by means of pedigrees and precedents, what share of the property is due to each of the claimants, and what relatives have forfeited their rights because they brought nothing that has some purchase value for such cases....
To conclude this paper I cannot but affirm once more that custom is the unique and universal basis of all Ifugao law, and that in the Ifugao mentality custom would be an idle word if it were not supported by genealogies. Ifugaw laws are not written on brazen tablets or on parchment; they are not carefully filed in Capitols or some other government buildings. Yet they are declared genuine, reliable and coercive thru the genealogical trees that exist imperfectly in the mind of the many and perfectly in the mind of the few, the expert genealogists.

If a conscientious man cultivates the land in the proper way, he helps in the rebuilding of the country. If it weren’t for agricultural products, all factories would stop. So it is clear that a man is a whether he works in a village or in a city, and one can’t live without the other. If a peasant has difficulty cultivating his land in the proper way he can learn a lot of things through magazines, the radio, and from agricultural experts.

“All potters measure the surfaces of their jars in one way or another,” although “there is a considerable individual variation in the amount of measuring that is done.” One customary measure is the distance between the thumb and the tip of the middle finger when spread apart. The procedure of one expert pottery maker is described as follows: “First she studied carefully for some minutes the undecorated form, turning it around in her hands. Then she measured hastily with her thumb and middle finger the greatest circumference of the jar. Then she drew in the outlines of the first design, which was to be used four times around the jar. After the first element was completed, she measured it and the remaining space and drew in the second element. The two together occupied a little more than half the space, so the remaining two had to be slightly crowded, but this was hardly perceptible in the finished product.” One informant commented: “If I start to paint before it is all measured, then I get nervous that it may not come out right.”

This transience of physicians has been the result, particularly in the past, of the lower salaries offered by the civil service to its personnel and of the use of government hospitals by foreign-trained physicians as an intermediate step in obtaining permanent licences to practise in a province. The fact that at least two of these physicians have been in the process of securing permanent licences is known to most Six Nations with various degrees of accuracy about the actual procedures involved. This has had a very detrimental effect on the doctor's image as a skilled specialist. Because of this belief in their lack of training, the physicians who are obtained and (or) remain at the hospital for any period of time are generally thought to be inadequately equipped to cope with the medical responsibilities of the outside medical world (i.e., non-reserve white world). The physicians are consequently dubbed “second rate,” and said to be “only practising” (i.e., learning). It is further believed that they are not capable enough to be acceptable to the white Canadians and are therefore, according to the reputed evaluation of the Federal Government, “good enough” for the Indian. From this derives the not infrequently expressed belief that the physicians are using the Indian people as “guinea pigs.”
Further substantiating their unfavourable judgment of the physicians' role qualifications are many factors the non-conservatives perceive in the operation of the hospital or, in other words, in the role performance of the doctors. Referral services are utilized to a great extent by the physicians, as they were by Dr. Davis in the past, but it is claimed that “if they were doing their job” this external reliance need not be so great. Since all the physicians presently on staff (and all those hired since 1950 except two certified surgeons and three in public health) are general practitioners, this dependence on outside specialists and hospital facilities is unavoidable. Even with the expanded scale of organization the hospital is still small and is not equipped with the technical machinery now available to doctors for more sensitive and extensive diagnostic and surgical procedures. As a result of the limited array of surgical equipment, for example, and the lack of certified surgeons and anaesthetists, surgery is maintained only on a very limited scale. Recent surgery has been limited to operations for hernias, obstetrics, tonsillectomies, and appendectomies, and now it is considered desirable for even these cases to be referred elsewhere.

During the day Byron Adams, a Hopi missionary, and a white field nurse asked my mother to give the little boy to them for adoption, promising that when he grew up he might return to help our people. Since Frank was away, my mother decided to part with the baby. They took him to New Oraibi, and there the nurse untied the special string that we had bound to the navel cord. This let air into the baby's belly and caused it to swell up. The Whites also cut off a piece of the little boy's penis—calling the operation circumcision—something that we Hopi would never do. The child did not live very long, of course, and they buried him in a box in the Christian cemetery without a grave ladder and without food. I did not go near, but I felt like slapping the nurse who was supposed to be an expert but who had never learned the simplest things about babies. When I saw her afterwards, I wanted to give her hell, but realized that she would probably go to hell soon enough anyway, for surely her God would never let her get to heaven.

By and large, senior men used to spend as much time as they possibly could on their main countries of orientation, which were usually, but not always, those of their patrilineal clans. This localisation of senior men was closely tied to the distribution of mythological knowledge, because knowledge of myths, [Page 49] totemic designs and, in particular, ancestral songs creates very strong sentimental bonds between people and places associated with the myths, designs and songs. As men grew older and more knowledgeable for particular countries, they also became more sentimentally attached to those countries. Myths and songs, being essentially nationalistic, describe countries in terms of greatly exaggerated positive characteristics -- greenness, productivity, fertility, well wateredness and so on. These idealisations also make constant reference to love of, and longing for, home by the ancestors. Elder men, then, who were in the process of becoming these very ancestors, tended to speak of their countries as if they could never leave them -- indeed, as if they never had left them

In the ancient world, astronomy owed its development to the requirements of agriculture and became the specialty of priests in agricultural cults. In Micronesia, astronomy owes its development to the requirements of navigation. Knowledge of the stars, their names and movements, is very largely restricted to professional navigators. 1 As private, incorporeal property -- a trade secret --it is bequeathed in the Central Carolines from father to son, and among these matrilineal peoples, from mother’s brother to sister’s son. Anyone unable to acquire such knowledge in this way must purchase it from its owners. 2 Where the art of navigation has been lost, astronomy, as one of its adjuncts, has also disappeared. 3 Native astronomy, therefore, has aimed at meeting the practical problems of sailors, whose lives depended on it. Its form as a primitive science is a direct result of this orientation.
1 Cf. Grimble (1931:197), who says of the Gilbertene: “If you would find an expert on stars, you must ask for a tiaborau or navigator. This fact [illegible] a correct measure of the significance of astronomy to the native; he regards it as a mere adjunct (though an important one) to the larger science of navigation.” Erland (1914: 76-78) reports a similar situation in the [illegible]

The fact that the principal educator of a boy is his father has far-reaching consequences. Since the Bororo headman, boe eimejera , should be a good hunter, a good fisherman, a good craftsman, and above all an intellectual with great knowledge of tribal traditions, myths, and songs, and since all skills and knowledge are acquired from one's fathers and initiators, the office of headman is not transmitted matrilineally but goes from father to son. One may also become knowledgeable without having a knowledgeable father. He may receive the desired instruction from some other man, but only if he pays the man, i.e., if he gives presents of food in exchange for information. From his matrilineage, from his classificatory brothers, and from his namegiver (if he is one of his brothers) a man will inherit the right to ceremonial performances, names, and songs; but he will not be taught how to perform the ceremonies or how to sing the songs unless he pays his instructors. I quote here the words of a headman, which convey the Bororo thoughts about education:
If your father is a knowledgeable man, if he is a chief of the Bororo, he will want you to be like him, to be as knowledgeable as he is. He will will die but you will be here in his place, you will be the chief of the Bororo in his place. With this in mind he instructed you in all these things.
But suppose you do not listen to your father's [Page 105] words. He wants to teach you but you do not care and as a consequence you remain ignorant. The people will say, “It may be that his father was ignorant, and because of this he does not know anything.” I know things and thus the people do not gossip about my father. People say about me, “With him is his father's knowledge and reason.”
Another example. The people do not quarrel with your father or with your mother, nor do they quarrel with you; they will say, “Yes, he is the true child of his parents, he is just like they are.” But if you fight and quarrel with people, they will say: “He is not the child of his parents; they are different.”
However, if your father does not know things, you will kill some animal, you will catch some fish, and you will give them to someone who knows things, and he will teach you. The people will then say, “The father is no good, and yet his son speaks so well. He is not stingy with meat and fish and feathers. He is knowledgeable, because he is not stingy. So after having been an orphan, he is not an orphan anymore.”

In the course of centuries many lineages have evolved while others have died out or have become fused together. Today, even among the most knowledgeable priests and elders, there is little agreement beyond these eight lineages, and the many questions referring to traditional marriage rules have become topics which are often discussed by men during their nightly reunions in the village temple. Quite obviously these rules had been established in the remote past, and were meant to function in a much larger society, much of it nucleated in extensive settlements and even in and around urban centers. But after the defeat and dispersion at the hands of the Spanish troops, cluminating around 1600, the details of social organization and marriage rules have largely ceased to function and have not been adapted to changing social conditions.
