“Amongst all the tribes (but especially throughout the Gebelawi Nyam-nyam) there are recognised doctors, some purely spiritual (exorcists, diviners, witch-doctors, and devil-dancers), who correspond to the Mohammedan Fikis; others dealers [sic] in physic alone, and others again that combine the two offices, a classification very similar to that in Kordofan ( vide Ibid, Third Report).
The doctor, in the Zandeh tongue, is termed Binza, sometimes Kugour (a bastard word) by the Gours, Dakaoa, and amongst the semi-civilised of both races Hakim, the Arab name. He usually traffics from place to place armed with a paraphernalia of drugs, dressings, and implements (Plate XVII., figs. 2, 3, 5, 6, 9), often, too, with the native wooden pillow (Fig. 62). One such with whom I came in contact at Meridi....Bonda (1) by name [WB: figure not duplicated for files], applied himself solely to physic and the supernatural. He would have no truck with obstetrics or surgery....the former remaining in the hands of married women, aided sometimes by small boys....

There are besides these professional doctors a community which might be termed [Page 248b] ‘hereditary specialists,’ their secret knowledge of remedies and incantations, for special cases, being jealously guarded and passed on from father to son. Such family remedies form quite a feature of savage medicine as they must have done in ancient Egyptian days when the ‘profession’ was entirely composed of ‘specialists.’ For his fee the doctor may be rewarded in ‘kind’ (grain, chickens, eggs, etc.) or in the very primitive ‘coin of the realm’ shown in Plate XIX., figs. 1-4.”

Abortion is very prevalent among the southern Azande. They make use of leaves of a secret plant for this purpose. Since even the natives themselves consider abortion a punishable offense, it is difficult to find out anything about it. But the knowledge of this treatment does not seem to be restricted to a few experts, as it usually is.

Hima- Ngorongba. --Sickness of the “Ngorongba” called [250] also, sickness of the “Paka”. The ngorongba or the paka is a small pustule recognizable only by specialists, which appears in the hairy parts of the body of the man or woman. The presence of this pustule on the body of the father or mother causes the death of the child when the latter has attained the age of one or two years. Therefore, the parents are conducted by the members of the family to a stony open space, called a monga. They crouch on the ground completely nude, and while the medical specialists look for pustules in the hair, the members of the family make a great clamor and direct the most curious possible terms towards the mother and the father. This procedure facilitates the working of the medicine and renders the pustules more visible; because the latter are well hidden and permit themselves to be discovered more easily during the noise of the insults. Once found they are scratched from the skin with a knife. There are no other remedies.

I never intruded upon private conversations between Kamanga and Badobo, his teacher, however dilatory their conduct. The astuteness of the teacher would have surprised me more had it not been that I was well acquainted with the extreme credulity of his pupil, whose deep faith in magicians never ceased to astonish me, though I had daily evidence of it. Subtle procrastination might well have persuaded me to jettison my inquiry into the technique of witch-doctors in favour of other anthropological cargo had it not been for the arrival of a noted witch-doctor on a professional tour from a distant district. This man, named Bögwözu, was arrogant towards the local practitioners, whom he treated with alternating contempt and condescension. Badobo bore his conceit less easily than the other witch-doctors since he was used to the deference now paid to his rival.
Here was an opportunity to be seized at once, since it might not recur. I flattered Bögwözu’s self-esteem, suggested that he should take over the tuition of Kamanga, and offered to pay him munificently so long as he taught his pupil all he knew. I explained to him that I was tired of Badobo’s wiliness and extortion, and that I expected my generosity to be reciprocated by the equipment of Kamanga with something more than exoteric knowledge of a witch-doctor’s technique. To Badobo I excused myself on the grounds that this new practitioner was distinguished in his profession and had qualified among the neighbouring Baka people, who are renowned for their magic, as well as among Azande, so that he could teach Kamanga the medicines of two cultures. At the same time Badobo was to continue his instruction and receive remuneration for his services.
When informants fall out anthropologists come into their own. The rivalry between these two practitioners grew into bitter and ill-concealed hostility. Bögwözu gave me information about medicines and magical rites to prove that his rival was ignorant of the one or incapable in the performance of the other. Badobo became alert and showed himself no less eager to demonstrate his knowledge of magic both to Kamanga and to myself. They vied with each other to gain ascendancy among the local practitioners. Kamanga and I reaped a full harvest in this quarrel, not only from the protagonists themselves but also from other witch-doctors in the neighbourhood, and even from interested laymen.

There are sure to be witches among the audience, and these naturally hate the witch-doctors who are on their track. They try to make their feet heavy so that they become easily tired and cannot dance well. They try to spoil their songs by preventing people from backing up their chorus. They try to confuse the drummers so that they fail to correlate their beats with the rhythm of song and dance. Most of all, they attempt to bemuse the performers so that they cannot divine correctly. The practitioners dance with all their might against these witches and utter spells against them, and if seriously annoyed may even shoot pieces of bone into their bodies and afterwards extract them in order to show every one that they are alert. They also object to people who come and stand watching them in a superior and condescending manner instead of sitting down respectfully like the rest of the audience. They fix their eyes on these men in a ferocious stare, and unless they sit down at once shoot pieces of bone into them so that when the recipient of a shaft returns home in the evening a slight illness will remind him of his misdemeanour. When a witch-doctor has shot at a person he may walk up to him and theatrically remove his shaft, generally from the forehead when the missile is a black beetle. The man himself says that a witch-doctor has extracted a missile of witchcraft from his body. Other people think the witch-doctor has shot him because he is a witch. Every one interprets such actions as he pleases. They are not important.
When a witch-doctor shoots a missile at any one he does so by raising his leg and sharply kicking it out in the direction of his objective. One will often see him aim a kick in this manner towards another witch-doctor, and his sally results in a lively duel between the two. They advance forward into the dancing space, eyeing one another keenly, make a few preliminary hops, and then start a spirited duel of dancing. Suddenly one of them kicks his foot out towards his fellow practitioner who twists round with agility to allow the bone shaft to sail past him. The [Page 180] latter retaliates by shooting in the same manner at his companion, whose turn it is to avoid the missile. Members of the audience prefer not to be in direct line of fire during these bouts, lest a bone or splinter shoots past its objective and becomes embedded in their bodies. If one of the combatants shoots his opponent he walks up to him and removes his missile with evident triumph. Generally these fights are sham encounters staged in order that witch-doctors may show off their abilities before their audience, but when the protagonists are jealous of one another there is frequently an element of ill nature in the display. If professional rivalry tends to embitter the sport, a third witch-doctor sometimes dances in between the opponents, waving his hand up and down to placate them. Kamanga gained a triumph during our trek in the Belgian Congo. After a long and exhausting battle with another witch-doctor who had resented his presence in the district as an act of professional poaching, Kamanga caused his hat and leglets to fall off during the engagement by means of his magic ammunition. When a combat is a friendly duel, engaged in solely for spectacular effect, the two practitioners often walk up to each other at the end of it and shake hands.

In the old days, when there were very few witch-doctors, they must have been on a par with ordinary specialists in magic, differing from them only in degree and mode of specialization. A great increase in their numbers in late years and the greater spacial density created by Government settlements have resulted in a larger measure of joint activity. Some kind of initiation of a new member in the corporation has always taken place, but it can hardly have been a ceremony attended by such a strong body of practitioners as those who assist at it to-day. Communal meals, at which a number of witch-doctors gather round a fire and eat medicines together, are now a regular feature of their professional life. To-day seances are usually conducted jointly by a number of witch-doctors, and it is only princes and wealthy commoners, the conservative [Page 203] element in society, who still summon a single practitioner to dance for them. However, witch-doctors always act singly in their capacity of leeches.
Co-operating together in these ways tends to produce group sentiment and group machinery, but of an essentially local character, never national or even tribal. In each district witch-doctors largely act together, but normally they do not act jointly with witch-doctors of other districts. It is not the structure of the corporation which gives cohesion to all its members, but a number of separate magicians, living in one small area, possessing common magic, and acting together in a number of their magical functions, who tend in consequence to form an organization.
Joint local functioning tends in the same manner to produce leadership, though not permanent or institutional leadership. What I have already written about the conduct of a seance is sufficient to show that some degree, in point of fact quite a high degree, of co-ordination of behaviour is essential. The spacial arrangements of the dancing place and the mode of dancing by themselves necessitate some kind of organization and leadership. But the full functions of leadership will be clearer when I have described also the esoteric side of a witch-doctor’s life.
Azande have an unusually well-developed political sense, and any joint activity in which they engage takes on the pattern of their political structure. There is always a gbia of any undertaking. This word properly means ‘noble’ but may also be used simply as a title of respect to a commoner, and in this context refers to the leader in an activity. When a member of the aristocracy enters into an activity he is almost invariably the gbia, or stands largely outside its organization. When the undertaking is manned by commoners one of them will act as the gbia, on the pattern of the noble-commoner relationship, though without its full content. I have explained earlier that nobles do not become witch-doctors, so that it is always a commoner who acts as leader on the ground of age, experience, personality, achievement, and knowledge of magic. Wealth and social position also qualify a man to some extent to play a leading role, even when his experience and knowledge [Page 204] of magic are smaller than those possessed by other members of the corporation.

Thus, in our settlement, when Bage performed at seances he took a leading part, since he carried his political status with him into a sphere of life where he was not acting as a political agent. But the real leader was Badobo. Badobo, a man of middle age, had possessed witch-doctors’ magic for a longer time than any one else in our neighbourhood. His father had been a witch-doctor before him and had initiated him into the craft as a boy. He was tactful, but did not show any of the striking characters which usually designate a leader, and his central position among the local practitioners was derived mainly from his personal relations with each individual, since he had taught most of them their knowledge of medicines and had sponsored them at initiation. There were two or three other practitioners who were thought to equal Badobo in professional skill, but they lacked the same personal following derived from dependence of pupil on teacher.

When a youth applies to a witch-doctor for tuition the transference is much shorter and is complicated by payments, 1 and by the formation of personal attitudes, which have to be built up outside family and household. The young man is asked by his future teacher whether he is quite certain that he wishes to be initiated and is exhorted to consider the dangers which may beset his relations and himself if he attempts to acquire the magic half-heartedly. He will also be reminded that the magic is rare and expensive, and that his teacher will require frequent and substantial gifts. If he persists in his desire to become a practitioner the older man will consent to teach him the art. His relatives are unlikely to object if their poison oracle foresees no unfortunate outcome for the youth or themselves.
1 It is likely that some small payment is made by son to father as the payments form part of the ritual of initiation, but I am not sure about this point.
A novice begins to eat medicines with other witch-doctors to strengthen his soul and give him powers of prophesy; he is initiated into the corporation by public burial; he is given [Page 206] witchcraft-phlegm to swallow; and he is taken to a stream-source and shown the various herbs and shrubs and trees from which the medicines are derived. This is the order of becoming a witch-doctor that I have observed. However, there is no fixed sequence in these rites.
I have often observed three or four witch-doctors, and sometimes as many as seven or eight, gather in the homestead of an experienced colleague, who knows all the medicinal herbs and trees from which a magic stew is made, and there partake of a communal meal. This senior witch-doctor, who is also generally the owner of the homestead at which the ceremony takes place, has already dug up in the bush a number of roots, and scraped and washed them preparatory to cooking. He places them with water in a pot and he and his colleagues gather round the fire to watch them boil. They chat and joke among themselves about a variety of secular subjects, though the affairs of their profession are also sometimes discussed. They display no outward manifestations of awe and reverence. After the water has boiled for some time and become coloured from the juices of the plants, the witch-doctor who has gathered them and is cooking them, and whom I shall refer to as their owner, takes the pot off the fire and pours out the liquid into a second pot, which he places on the fire for further boiling. The roots from which the juices have been extracted are removed to a nearby hut, where they are stored for another occasion.
At this point the witch-doctors commence to rivet their attention upon the business in hand, drop their secular conversation, and develop a noticeable degree of concentration on the medicinal juices now boiling on the fire. This is the first sign in their behaviour that they are dealing with magical forces. Spells from this point accompany various phases of the cooking and continue seriatim till the end of the ceremony. When the owner is pouring out his medicinal juices into a second pot for their further boiling he generally addresses them in a few words, asking for the welfare of witch-doctors as a whole and for the success of their professional interests. He [Page 207] then divides up a ball of paste, made from oil-bearing seeds ground down with a magic root, into several small round balls, one for each witch-doctor present. The owner places these along the periphery of the pot and first he and then each witch-doctor in order of seniority flicks his ball into the pot. The owner now takes a little wooden stirrer and slowly stirs the oil in the juices, addressing the medicines as he does so, partly on his own behalf and partly on behalf of the novice whom he is initiating:
‘May no evil fall upon me, but let me rest in peace. ... May men hear my renown in the kingdom of Renzi to the south and in the far north among the foreigners at Wau.’ ... When there are only two or three fully qualified witch-doctors and no novices present, each stirs and addresses the medicines and eats of them without necessarily making a preliminary payment to their owner, but when there are a large number of witch-doctors, including several novices present, it is customary for the owner not to allow them free spells, but to demand a fee from each person who par-takes of the communal meal. He tells them that he will not take the pot off the fire until every one has made a payment. Whereupon each witch-doctor produces half a piastre, or a small knife, or a ring, and places it on the ground in front of the fire or even in the pot itself. These payments must be placed in the sight of the medicines, which normally must be bought or they will not be potent. Purchase is a part of the ritual conditioning of the magic which gives it potency. I have even seen a witch-doctor who was treating a patient for nothing place a piastre of his own on the ground, and when I asked him what he was doing he explained that it would be a bad thing if the medicine did not observe a fee, for it might lose its potency. If any one fails to produce a gift the owner may threaten to leave the medicine on the fire and let it burn, or, it is said, he may sometimes remove it from the fire, but not let any of his colleagues eat it till they have made sufficient payments. The medicines are his. He gathered them in the bush and prepared them and cooked them in his own utensils. He is their owner and they must be purchased from him. It must be remembered that since magic which is not purchased in this manner is of doubtful potency it is to the advantage of the eater to pay a small fee, as well as to the advantage of the owner to receive it, for not only does payment of a fee form an integral part of the magic ritual, but also in Zande-land it is thought essential that when magical powers are [Page 210] transmitted from one person to another their seller should be satisfied with the deal, since otherwise they will lose their powers in the transference. The goodwill of the owner is also a relevant condition in the sale of magic, and his goodwill can be assured by a small payment.

References have been made to rivalry among witch-doctors. I described how they dance against one another at seances, and how one may try to shoot magic shafts into the body of his colleague and incapacitate him from dancing and prophesying efficiently. The rivalry between Badobo and Bögwözu runs through the whole account of Kamanga’s initiation. Further reference to these jealousies is now made, because a large number of the medicines which are taught to a novice have as their function the equipment of defensive and aggressive powers against professional rivals. There is little jealousy between junior witch-doctors, but when a man has gained a professional reputation it is certain to clash with the interests of others who have been longer established in the district. These doctors try to build up for themselves practices among laymen, and as they derive both wealth and reputation from them they are envious of the encroachment of others. In the case of Bögwözu every local practitioner of standing was hostile towards him as he was a stranger from a different locality and was considered a trespasser in their area. But before Bögwözu’s arrival there had been concealed hostility between Badobo and another witch-doctor, Alenvo, who came to live in our [Page 246] settlement from his home about a mile away, and there were the beginnings of other jealousies. The jealousy of witch-doctors is proverbial among Azande.

This social differentiation has its ritual side also, for the witch-doctor performs for a large number of people at a seance what each would otherwise have to do himself by means of oracles and various forms of protective magic. On these occasions the community trusts to him to look after their interests by keeping an eye on witches, exposing their intentions, and frustrating them. In all important situations each Zande uses magic for himself or pays a specialist to perform rites on his behalf, but we may think of the witch-doctor as a special agent summoned from time to time with a general commission to ferret out witch-activities in the neighbourhood and to protect people against them.

Azande who have seen our drugs regard them as they regard their own. Their therapeutic value is limited and lies in some mystical quality in the drug itself. Hence I could not persuade them to use even the simplest drugs as they were intended to be used nor convince them that a drug which was suitable for one ailment might not be used for other ailments. My experience as an amateur physician was that Azande would consult me about aphrodisiacs and about what they consider to be minor complaints, sores, stomach-ache, headache, and so forth; but when a complaint was serious they took serious measures to counteract it and consulted oracles and employed witch-doctors. Perhaps in my case they were wise. Nevertheless, the attitude of mind that led many of my patients to desert me for native practitioners is mystical, for they think that our drugs, like their own, are useful in treating external symptoms and may be adequate to eradicate minor complaints, but by themselves they have no effect on the causes of serious illnesses, witchcraft and sorcery, which can only be counteracted by the use of oracles and magic. Azande feel that European drugs are suitable for Europeans and Zande drugs for Azande.

A youth wishing to be initiated will apply to a practitioner and make him continual payments, for magic is a personal possession and is [Page 526] only efficacious when willingly given and paid for. Abinza meet and together partake in ritual fashion of their medicine; initiates undergoing training will attend these meetings and take full part in them. One of the abinza (usually a senior practitioner) who provides the meal will be paid by the participants, and this must be done in the presence of the medicine, which is thought to realize what is happening. He collects the required ingredients, recites magic formulae over them, and cooks them in the presence of his colleagues; the noviciates hold their heads in the steam rising from the pot and all partake of the medicine in the prescribed manner. Incisions are made on the chest and some of the fluid rubbed in, the residue being preserved in medicine horns. The medicine gives both physical and spiritual strength, and during a séance a medicine-man feels it stirring within him (even though he may not have eaten a ritual meal for a long time) and then begins to dance. The novice will be taught to recognize the plants from which medicines are made, and will be taken to the ravines where the most secret ones grow. These ravines, where streams arise, are dangerous places, for here Mböli broods and the atoro dwell. This was the only connection that Professor Evans-Pritchard was able to find between spirits of the dead and magic, and this according to his informants was only accidental; in these ravines the secret herbs grew, and it was here that the spirits dwelt, but the efficacy of the herbs was not believed to be due to the spirits or to Mböli.

It would be a mistake, however, to exaggerate the role of genealogical information in the politics of Amhara land tenure and to suggest that knowledge is power. Many men with genealogical expertise are without political influence because they lack the other attributes of leadership, and many men with influence have attained the office of fej [leadership role], though their knowledge of the ancestors is limited. In the last analysis, particularly in major land disputes involving claims through division by father, it is not so much that knowledge of the genealogical charter is power, as it is that power enables those who wield it to enunciate an authoritative version of the charter.

The rist system, with its overlapping and ambiguous land rights, its ever-present possibilities for upward mobility at the expense of others, and the premium it places on political expertise, produces what, in comparison with many other agrarian systems, appears to be a high degree of endemic competition for and conflict over land. ... conflict over land is partly limited by the principle that land belongs to the resident members of a descent corporation or of a village and should be periodically redistributed in equal shares to all household heads.

The association of the debtera with the church has increased his activities in recent years from that of amulet-writer and herbologist to many of the functions of outright magic, particularly since the tenqway has become illegal. The debtera always seems to have enjoyed the highest respectability and trust of any of the practitioners, since (as in ancient Greece), his activity in the official religion is believed to extend over the ills of the body and over the world of the spirits. There is no philosophical basis for the development of medical systems among the Amhara, thus no reasoned system. Their medical concepts are pre-Galen, at most Aristotelian. The debtera have, or in some cases claim to have, books handed down from past centuries, containing secret formulae, recipes, pharmacopeia of an intermingled empirical and magical nature. They warn inquirers that the public revelation of these secrets would create great social dangers at the hands of the irresponsible.

Unlike the other medical practitioners mentioned earlier, the wegesha does not try to dominate nature: he specializes in utilizing what nature provides, and in lending a helping hand. He is most often the first consulted, a kind of general [Page 292] practitioner or family doctor, and since he refrains from magical undertakings, he is neither feared nor suspected of witchcraft, which the other practitioners (even the debtera) often are.
The wegesha usually learns his craft from his father, while serving him as apprentice. But at present (1955) the most popular wegesha in the town of Gonder is a well-known former bandit who has gained an enviable reputation as a skilled surgeon. The wegesha is usually a diplomat in his human relations, much like the old-time Western family doctor. He usually tries to remain on good terms with the local church, and often invites the local debtera to dinner at his house, especially on saints’ days, to avoid their competitive hostility and to discuss some cases on a “professional” level.
The pulse is of no interest to the wegesha (unlike ancient practitioners in Asia). He relies as heavily on violent purgatives as the ancient Egyptians, and on cauterization (much in the ancient Hippocratic tradition).
Other medical helpers, apprentices, or modern “dressers”, may be referred to as “healers”: ( f[unknown]wwa[unknown]s ) or bal[unknown] m[unknown]dhanit (lit. owner of medicine), who knows empirical drugs and cures, “caretaker” ( ast’[unknown]bbak’i ), male nurse ( mogzit ), modern “dresser” ( astamami ). None of these are respected professions, for they are regarded as too close to manual labor, and such practitioners usually go to other provinces where their work will not shame the family. In recent years, the more skilled ones have been coming from Eritrea.
The more common ailments treated and procedures followed by the wegesha and debtera (practitioners who occasionally overlap in specialties, but almost never in treatment), include the following: Table 10

The debtera student’s ecclesiastical studies are divided into three broad categories: (1) kiyne, versifications in the form of conundrums; (2) subjects relevant to the celebration of the mass, such as zeyma (liturgical music), akwawkum (liturgical dance), and a variety of liturgical chants, (e.g., soma [Page 251] digwa, songs and hymns of Lent); and (3) tergum, scriptural interpretation. Ideally a student spends enough time with a debtera master in each subject to become proficient according to the master’s standards, and to acquire mastery of one subject so that he may, in his turn, offer instruction in it. Studies usually begin with kiyne . In the kiyne drills a boy learns Ge’ez, the language of the church, and develops the habits of diligence and concentration and the acuity of mind that are necessary for his later studies. Students consider the kiyne curriculum to be very difficult, for in addition to mastering the subtleties of versification, they must memorize great amounts of scriptural and liturgical information. Typically, a new boy is warmly received as a “younger brother,” but offers of help soon give way to competition as the established students come to regard him as a rival for the master’s personal instruction and encouragement. To be the master’s favorite means rapid advancement through the curriculum and a seat at his table. Without his patronship, a student is committed to years of physical misery, scraping to meet his subsistence needs, and paying his “tuition” in arduous and humbling ways, by gathering wood for the master’s fire, tilling his garden, and washing the feet of the master and his visitors.

Debtera use the term abinet to refer to recondite works which satisfy some personal interest. The efficacy of abinet is obtained wholly or in large measure by invoking supernaturals, usually in contexts beyond what the church permits.
Abinet subjects include (1) cures and prophylactic amulets; (2) works with academic ( timhirt ) goals; (3) works protecting property and stimulating its increase; (4) works for gaining respect, love, and favorable treatment; (5) accurate divination through dreams, (6) divinatory texts ( awdunigist ); (7) works for sending sickness and other misfortunes; and (8) techniques for forcing the appearance and co-operation of demons ( ganel )....
A boy rarely begins his debtera career intending to learn abinet, and he acquires his first examples almost inadvertently. Subsequent abinet are collected gradually, as he rethinks from practical and moral points of view the differences between abinet which directly satisfy some immediate personal need and abinet which enable him to sell a service to others, and as he accumulates an effective professional capital of abinet.
With few exceptions, a student’s first abinet are therapies for the ailments which afflict him, and abinet to improve his memory and acuity for learning kiyne . These first abinet are generally gifts from student friends ( gwadenya ) and mess-mates ( balinjera ), since a boy rarely possesses anything beyond friendship, deference, and abjectness with which he can appeal to a potential donor. Among these companions favors are expected to be freely given and no formal accounting is made. Beyond this circle all students are implicitly rivals ( towdaderiy ). Another source of abinet at this time is some older, more knowledgeable student. Here, the relationship between donor and recipient is framed as an exchange between a patron ( radat ) and his client ( taraj ), a customary dyad contrasting power with dependency, and generosity with deference. The new boy appeals that he is abject and threatened by mortal dangers; the donor, by his gift, publicly asserts a status difference which sets him off from novices in general.

Second, there is a practical problem of storing the recipes’ elaborate instructions for identifying, gathering, processing and administering materia medica . While the debtera can record all this in writing, the illiterate layman has only his memory. There is another serious social obstacle that would have to be reckoned with once it came to public attention that he was engaged in this unusual activity. Interests of this sort are inevitably interpreted as evidence that the collector aspires to be a “magician” ( asmatenya ) and that his ultimate goals are antisocial ones. Finally, secular healers (particularly the expert curer, the medhaniyt awakiy ) are reluctant to share professional knowledge with other secular healers, even when a reasonable price is offered. Unlike the abinet capital of debtera, the herbalist’s medical capital dissipates as it is “spent.” When two debtera exchange subjects, neither considers the other a rival in the specialties which they exchange. Eventually, their paths are bound to part, as one or the other continues his travels. Moreover, a debtera is not known for specific works, since his public reputation rests upon his access to generic powers. Instead, he is recognized by his public as being either “strong” or “weak,” and if he is reputed to be “strong,” a potential client assumes that he is competent to treat a broad range of maladies. In contrast, the professional reputation of the lay healer is tied to a specific ailment, just as he himself is tied to a specific locality. Since a layman’s medical reputation is fixed in space, potential purchasers of his medical knowledge are drawn from among his potential clients. Thus, by sharing his medical knowledge with another secular healer, the lay practitioner establishes a potential rival and dilutes the economic and social advantages of his practice.

The Habe[unknown]sa hakiyms (“Abyssinian healer”) can be sorted into three mutually exclusive categories, each defined analytically, according to shared professional titles.
Category 1. Physical manipulation of the sickman’s person is dominant, and the employment of materia medica is either absent or subordinated to these physical manipulations. These healing powers are compatible with the first and second therapeutic strategies discussed in Chapter One. Any therapist of this category, with the exception of the awalaj (midwife), can be referred to as “ wogey[unknown]sa ”. The exclusion of the midwife is probably a sexual one, since practitioners known as wogey[unknown]sa are almost invariably male, while the awalaj is always a woman. Operationally, healers of the first category are distinguished from one another by their different organ domains---bone and jimat, teeth and jaws, tonsils and uvula, womb and associated organs.
Category 2. Therapeutic success relies on the use of medicaments; practitioners of this category utilize the third therapeutic strategy. Although no single term properly distinguishes these therapists from other categories of practitioners, they are, as a class, described by a common set of professional titles. Each title consists of three terms. The first indicates the name of the ailment for which the practitioner owns a therapy. Unlike other categories of practitioners, professional titles among these therapists are specific for single named ailments, rather than for a range of ailments. The second term is always the word “ medhaniyt ” (“medicament”). The maker of therapeutic amulets is the single exception to this (e.g., yidemaketir kitab kitabiy , “amulet maker for post-partum bleeding”). The final term indicates the format and “completeness” of the herbal therapy practiced. Thus, the “ yianfula medhaniyt awakiy ” is the “medicine expert for the ailment known as anfula ”.
Category 3. Therapeutic success derives from the practitioner’s intimacy with spirit beings ( ganel , zar , or saint of the Church) and his familiarity with magic ( asmat ); he relies upon the fourth therapeutic strategy. The term “ tonkway ” is sometimes used to denote the most prominant practitioners of this category, the debtera - [Page 30] and balazar -healers, but semantically that term tends to emphasize the practitioner’s ability as a seer rather than as a therapist. Moreover, the atmakiy (annointer) is never referred to as “ tonkway ”, even though his powers are also derived from supernaturals. When, in conversation, it is necessary to distinguish this category of practitioner (including the atmakiy ) from the “secular healer” (categories 1 and 2), the title ‘ wogey[unknown]sa ’ is extended to subsume all of the latter as a class.

Wogey[unknown]sas s are divided into three named categories, the tagañ , the intil korac , and the yiters medhaniyt awakiy . Practitioners in each category diagnose a set of related ailments, perform therapeutic operations to remedy them, and administer prophylaxis to prevent the development of ailments to which the therapy makes the sickman vulnerable. Laymen have little difficulty in selecting an appropriate kind of wogey[unknown]sa , since the ailments treated by each category of wogey[unknown]sa are characterized by unambiguous syndromes which are easily identified by laymen. In addition, a wogey[unknown]sa ’s range of medical competence is defined symptomatically; that is to say, his therapies are relevant to the entire range of etiological facts which can be associated with each syndrome he treats. This contrasts with herbalist therapies which are each tied to a specific pathogenic agent, so that often symptomatic information is of itself insufficient for determining whether the therapy of a particular category of herbalist is appropriate to the disease episode at hand. The following paragraphs describe the sequence of activities which characterize the professional activities of each category of wogey[unknown]sa.
For the layman, the symptoms of fracture ( sebero ) and therapeutically related ailments are distinctive [Page 34] enough to limit selection of a practitioner to the tagañ , bonesetter. Symptomatically, these ailments are experienced by the Amhara as 1) severe local pain and 2) the inability to move the affected areas (generally limbs, extremeties, and joints). As with other categories of wogey[unknown]sa , the tagañ ’s range of competence, symptomatically defined, is clear cut from the layman’s point of view. There are ailments not treatable by a tagañ , although characterized by one or the other of these symptoms. In these instances, however, the two symptoms do not appear in combination, but are accompanied by other symptoms which fall unequivocally beyond the tagañ ’s competence. Kofa , for example, is an ailment not treated by the tagañ , although it is characterized by an inability to move the limbs. This syndrome includes, however, high fever and generalized pain, both beyond the tagañ ’s therapeutic powers. On his arrival at the sickman’s, the tagañ conducts his own diagnosis, examining the affected area and looking for other relevant symptoms. His interest is not so much to confirm the generic character of the ailment, as to discover its specific nature (sometimes classifiable under a disease name with which laymen are unfamiliar), and to evaluate the complexities of the specific case. A fracture ( sebero ) always involves more than a broken [Page 35] bone, for jimat cords in the area of the break are invariably stretched and malaligned. It is the twisted jimat , in fact, which prevent the sickman from moving the affected area, and whose effects the tagañ knows to be symptomatically dominant. Thus, the tagañ seeks to learn whether a bone has actually been broken, whether only jimat are involved (a condition known as walemta ), or whether an organ other than bone has distorted the jimat (for example, intrusive blood in an ailment known as setir ).

When an incision is made, an herbal poultice is placed over the cut and wrapped beneath the splint, as a precaution against subsequent infection ( kusil ). Every tagañ owns a recipe for an unguent, and the medicaments used in it are kept a professional secret. However, not all tagañ s have recipes for kusil prophylaxis. Without the latter, a tagañ who wishes to treat compound fractures must obtain the services of an herbalist whose specialty is the treatment of kusil . Similarly the tagañ who is able to treat compound fractures [Page 37] without the assistance of another practitioner is himself identifiable as a kusil herbalist ( yikusil medhaniyt awakiy ), a non- wogey[unknown]sa professional identity.
Alone among Amhara secular practitioners, the tagañ practices a therapy which immobilizes the sickman for an extended period. During recuperation, therapeutic massages must continue, and the instability of the sickman’s jimat preclude his moving about. When a tagañ is famous for difficult therapies, such as breaking and resetting improperly set bones or treating paralyzed limbs, he attracts sickmen from great distances. Since these sickmen cannot leave the tagañ until pronounced cured, they require access to local accomodations and the assistance of a relative or servant to prepare their meals and tend to other personal [Page 38] needs.

To be sure, there are some technical differences among the practitioners of a single named specialty---in the composition of medicaments (e.g., unguents), the instruments which are used, and the numerological content of therapies---but the advantage which any of these give a practitioner is in itself never sufficient to explain his record of therapeutic success. It is rather a wogey[unknown]sa ’s manual skills as a manipulator of errant body parts or as an excisor of diseased ones which is believed to set him apart from his less successful colleagues.
The wogey[unknown]sa ’s numerological information indicates optimal amounts of therapy, neither too slight to produce a remission of symptoms, nor so excessive that a new undesireable condition is caused the sickman. In tagañ [Page 42] therapies, for example, some practitioners contend that the single diagnostic massage for fracture is insufficient for setting a broken bone. They claim that a massage on each of three successive days is required; two days massage will not soften the bone enough for proper ailgnment, while four days massage may distort it. Similar numerological considerations in tagañ therapies relate to the manufacture of medicaments, the duration of the splinting period, the number of days during which atmit is consumed, and the number of repetitions required by the final massage. Because these numerological elements are considered inextricably bound, sometimes diffusely, to one or more other components of a therapy, they cannot be freely inserted into the therapies of other tagañ s.

The Amhara herbalist recognizes that the physical condition of the patient he confronts is the product of the latter’s age and the seriousness of his current afliction, and that these circumstances impose limits on how strenuous and prolonged a therapy the sickman can reasonably be expected to endure. Since treatment must be kept within these bounds, the practitioner is expected to stop the action of the primary medicine once the pathogen has been completely removed from the sickman’s body, or after the sickman’s condition allows no more purging and vomiting. In order to stop the action of this medicine, the sickman is given a counter-medicine, known as memele[unknown]sa . The uncontrolled action of the primary medicine is sometimes compared with the effects of poison ( mers ), and, indeed, “memele[unknown]sa” is also used as a gloss for “antidote”.
A client’s notion of a therapy’s completeness is based on the therapist’s demonstrated ability to process and administer (but not necessarily gather) his medicaments. It is mainly on the basis of the observable completeness of a therapy that the herbalist-owner is given a practitioner title by his potential clients. That is not to say that completeness is, of itself, a [Page 57] sufficient condition fro grading herbalists by title. Rather, it is the observed coincidence, within real therapies, of completeness together with a strong primary medicine and an effective memele[unknown]sa that in relevant. This relationship will be made clear in the following paragraphs, which describe each named category of Amhara herbalist.... 
An herbalist’s professional title incorporates both the name of the ailment which he treats and the practitioner category (according to completeness of therapy) into which he fits (e.g., yianfula [disease name] medhaniyt awakiy [herbalist category]). The least of these categories is “medhaniyt seci” . The medical activities of this practitioner are limited to gathering cateria medica and presenting them to his client, together with information regarding the proper processing and administration of these ingredients. The processing required is invariably simple, involves no magical elements, often is vague about relative proportions, non-commital regarding dosages and may even lack details concerning the requisite number of repetitions. Generally, the therapist is not present during the administration of the medicaments. Before presenting the medicinals to his client, the horbalist alters the ingredients, by crumbling leaves or denuding sprigs, so that the client will be unable to [Page 58] recognize them should he come across these botanicals in the wild.
Another practitioner, the medhaniyt ateci, presents his client with fully processed medicaments generally in the form of infusion, and provides information only regarding their administration. Medhaniyt ateci therapies are considered, as a class, more powerful that therapies practiced by the medhaniyt seci, by virtue of professional processing (particularly in the measurement of ingredients)....
A third category of herbalist, the medhaniyt awakiy (“medicine expert”) provides the most complete therapy, performing all relevant pharmacological activities himself. This class of therapies is associated with strong medicines, serious ailments, and the performance of a professional diagnosis. Diagnosis, in the sense of evaluating symptoms prior to the administration of therapy, takes place in the sickman’s homestead, among kinfolk and neighbors, and before a therapist is consulted. The “completeness” of the latter’s therapy determines whether there will be any further diagnosis. If he practices a complete therapy, the herbalist will perform a diagnosis after the primary medicine has been administered and its effect felt. Here, the therapist carefully examines the sickman’s evacuae (feces and vomit), in order to assess the medicine’s relevance [Page 59] to the sickman’s ailment and, if appropriate, its effectiveness in expelling the pathogenic substance. In the evacuae the therapist looks for evidence of the pathogenic substance itself (now rendered into amorphous pieces), worms ( tils ) which the pathogen may have produces, and the wastes of internal organs ravaged by the pathogen. In this diagnosis, the therapist applies criteria of color (white, green, black, and blood-red) and consistency (liquid, viscous, solid). The expected combinations and the putative significance of each are known only to the therapist, and expected combinations have no obvious symbolic relevance beyond the specific therapeutic context....
Sometimes the herbalist cites in addition the fees which he recives, as recognition of these “expert” abilities, and even of his client’s satisfaction with the therapy. In practice, a nominal fee is almost always paid, whatever the therapy’s success. The medhaniyt seci receives a token fee of perhaps E$.50 to E$1., and probably no more than three to five times that amount for a successful cure.

It is clear from the preceeding chapter that 1) herbalists are distinguished from other secular healers by a distinctive classificatory system, and 2) this distinction can be functionally related to certain features of the healers’ respective practices. Foremost among these features is the relative uniformity of healing powers of practitioners. While there is substantial uniformity within each named category of chirurgeon, 9 the herbalists working within any single disease-name specialty are arrayed along a wide range of powers and therapeutic [Page 83] effectiveness. The uniformity of the chirurgeons’ healing powers can be traced to the fact that their operations are relatively simple and easily learned. A man begins his apprenticeship while still a youth, under the tutledge of a senior kinsman. Generally, he does not assume professional status until his mentor has died or retired, or until he has moved beyond the natal parish and out of the range of possible competition with his healer-kinsman. In either event, the apprenticeship is lengthy enough to ensure technical mastery, within the limits set by the healer’s natural abilities. The tagañ (bonesetter) is an exception, since his operations are by no means simple, and his natural skills more significantly affect his success as a therapist. Thus, there are more considerable differences in healing powers among tagañs than among other chirurgeons.
9 For convenience, “chirurgeon” is used here to describe all secular practitioners who are not herbalists.

The logically maximal chain . Using these grades, a client can construct “chains” of real herbalists, ranging from least to most powerful, in the relevant disease-name specialty. The following formula contains all logically possible herbalist chains. In this description, the symbol “-[unknown]” is used to indicate that “therapeutic failure by the antecedent practitioner is followed by consultation with the following practitioner”....
Real chains avoid consultations with more than one practitioner of the same or adjacent grades. This simplification results from a tendency of clients to generalize from an experience with a specific herbalist to all herbalists of that grade and disease-name specialty. The therapeutic failure of a weak therapy, one provided by a medhaniyt seci or medhaniyt ateci , indicates to the client that nothing short of a strong therapy will be effective in this episode. The client’s freedom to generalize in this fashion is encouraged by several considerations. First, it is convenient for a client to treat all herbalists of the same grade as more or less pharmacological equals ( vide supra ). Second, in the [Page 87] case of serious and acute ailments, the exigencies of time force the client to seek rapid and efficient diagnosis as the prerequisite of an effective cure. To confine therapy to a single grade of herbalist is to minimize chances for an accurate diagnosis, since a second or third therapeutic failure at the same herbalist grade is diagnostically no more informative than the first failure. Even in the case of chronic ailments, it is unusual for a client to engage more than a single herbalist of the same grade. Instead, the client follows initial failure with therapeutic inactivity, which either remains permanent for the ailment in question, or is eventually ended by consulting a higher grade herbalist.
The relationship between practitioner, etiology, and syndrome is not always so clear-cut, however. Occaisionally, a client consults no herbalist at all, even though the syndrome at hand appears appropriate to an herbalist specialty. The client, instead chooses a debtera (or, less often a balazar ) as the initial healer in the episode. Like herbalists debtera s are sorted into a graded series according to differences in healing power. In the abstract, the client arranges the two types of practitioners into parallel and mutually distinct series, according to the sources of their respective healing powers. While the herbalist’s powers derive from prosaically transmitted pharmacological information, [Page 88] the debtera ’s powers are derived from his intimacy with spirit beings, the ganels....
Real herbalist chains are, then constructed by clients on an ad hoc basis. In constructing his herbalist chain, the client is dependent upon, first, the actual distribution of relevant practitioners within his environs, and, second, persons who can communicate this information to him. A client knows the herbal specialties of most residents of his own hamlet, and of the more prominent healers of the parish in which his hamlet is located. Beyond the parish, however, he knows the names of few secular practitioners, and these few are healers with whom he has stood previously as a client. To build his chain, he must often rely on information [Page 90] provided by kinsmen, neighbors, and lower grade herbalists who are familiar with the identity of professional colleagues in their own disease-name specialties. A client sometimes has difficulty finding local herbalists with which to staff a desired herbalist chain. The (“weak”) debtera is often a “convenient” choice to fill this deficiency. He is a member of a class of practitioners who are famous for practicing therapies for a wide variety of ailments. Moreover, the debtera is conspicuous. In ecclesiastical performances, divination, and providing prophylactic amulets, he is observed and patronized by many residents of the district in which he lives. Thus, although potential clients may not know his therapeutic repertoire in detail, he is considered a potentially relevant practitioner about whom clients are always likely to make active inquiries.

Kinship ties are an important means by which the peasant acquires and communicates information necessary for constructing herbalist chains. Since almost every herbalist therapy of the rural parish enjoys its own “pedigree”, or trans-generational reputation, the peasant herbalist is provided with means for 1) publicly validating his therapeutic claims, and 2) communicating the existence of the therapy to his potential clients. Potential clients frequently associate the ownership of a famous herbalist therapy with the members of a specific ambilineage, often identifiable by name. Both the ambilineage (whose identity is linked to its fields) and its medical reputation (which is tied to the ambilineage) are attached to a particular location. Since residence is most often viripatrilocal, the transmission of such therapeutic reputations is characterized by an agnatic bias. The male therapist moving to town, like [Page 134] the female moving away to her husband’s parish, is generally cut off from this reputation. Thus, the herbalist in the town must most often establish this professional existence and reputation de novo . There is no way in which he can stimulate clients to come his way other than by empirical proofs. If his therapy is directed against an ailment for which even expert herbalist therapy promises success in only a fraction of cases, or an ailment which is epidemiologically infrequent, his difficulties are so much the greater. Thus, in spite of Gondar’s relatively great population, the town contains only a handful of herbalists of provincial-wide fame. These same considerations dampen the herbalist’s readiness to acquire new disease-name specialties. In addition to the difficulties already noted in Chapter 2, such a therapist would likewise be forced to establish his new professional presence de novo , even though he enjoyed an already established reputation against another ailment.
The contrast between the place of herbalist therapies in town and country has been most notably effected by the relative accessibility of non-herbalist therapies in the town. This is a result of the concentration of non-herbalist practitioners in towns, and of the relative affluence enabling townsmen to purchase more expensive therapies.
A government hospital, located on the edge of Gondar provides the most important non-traditional therapies. Most townsfolk regard hospital therapy with considerable apprehension, because of its strangeness and of numerous apochryphal tales describing its therapies. Nevertheless, the Amhara does not dispute the power of Western medicine, at least regarding some ailments. This respect is largely explained by the demonstrated successes of Western medicine, and the fact that, operationally, it coincides with certain traditional notions of what powerful therapies should be like. In particular, the violent introjective mode associated with the most commonly experienced of hospital therapies, merify (injection), is regarded as consistent with notions of strong therapies. Moreover, the practitioner of Western medicine, like powerful traditional healers, is characterized by a general mastery over an extensive disease domain, through abstruse sources of power. Western therapy is not in general well integrated into traditional medical beliefs, but tends to be considered mainly from a pragnatic perspective. Thus, hospital therapy is a likely choice for ailments against which it has repeatedly demonstrated successful cures and against which traditional healers are predictably less successful. Conspicuous here are abscesses, ulcerations, and other superficial but potentially serious infections, [Page 136] known as kusil and ibac . In addition, Western therapy is sought for ailments which are serious and chronic, but for which traditional cures offer a poor prognosis or only palliatives. For these ailments (in particular, leprosy, kuntina ; chronic coughing, yisaal ba[unknown]siyta , including tuberculosis, yilib ba[unknown]siyta ; and a variety of stomach ailments, yihod himem and migaña ), Western medicine is believed to offer prognosis equal to that of powerful traditional non-secular therapies, but not necessarily superior to them.

The debtera ’s public explains his medical superiority over secular practitioners in terms of the technical differences which they perceive [Page 188] between the works performed by the two categories of healers. 31 Laymen conceive the debtera ’s healing powers as the product of his knowledge of asmat , possession of awdunigist , and intimacy with ganel familiars. Although the layman recognizes that his own knowledge of these matters is inexact, he assumes that the debtera ’s use of asmat , awdunigist , and familiars can be synthesized into an integral body of learning, skills, and practices. Two types of syntheses are believed possible. The first of these characterizes the “weak” ( tini[unknown]s ) debtera , already discussed in chapter three. This debtera lacks demon familiars, but he can perform awdunigist calculations and he possesses sufficient asmat to provide prophylactic amulets and a number of therapies. However, his prophylaxes are easily breached by powerful sorcerers or determined ganel s, and his therapeutic powers do not exceed those of secular herbalists. The second synthesis characterizes the awakiy debtera . Here, the debtera ’s professional title signals the possession of ganel familiars. [Page 189] The weak debtera ’s asmat are finite, prosaically acquired, and mainly limited to prophylactic applications; the awagly debtera , through his daemons has unlimited asmat resources. These asmat are equally effective in meeting prophylactic, therapeutic, and offensive ends, and are well beyond the abilities of any secular persons. Thanks to his ganel -tutors, the awakiy debtera divines with precision and reliability much greater than those of his lesser colleagues. In addition to using ganel -taught asm[unknown]at , the awakiy debtera can employ his daemons directly, particularly in offensive contexts.
31 The layman’s belief in the medical superiority of the awakiy debtera is asserted verbally, in the context of herbalist chains, and in the impressive fees paid to the debtera (for therapy, ten times and more the amount paid to a secular healer; for prophylaxes, fees between E$50. and E$300. are not uncommon).

The attitude of the secular healer towards his therapy is essentially possessive. From his perspective, the therapy is an immutable composition; its elements of asmat are individually unintelligible, and are sorted into combinations by rote. The layman’s medical powers are specific, for they are limited to exclusively therapeutic applications; moreover, they are fixed, since they are relevant to a small number of named and etiologically unrelated ailments. In contrast, the debtera ’s attitude towards his repertoire of medical knowledge is recognized as active and manipulative. Through his daemons, he has access to unlimited asmat ; what is more, he knows the lexicon of this magic and understands the syntax of therapeutic combinations. Thus, he is able to produce a great variety of therapeutic statements, each tailored to the specific vulnerabilities and needs of his client. The debtera is believed to own powers of very general [Page 193] application. In a medical context, he is adept in all but the chirurgeon’s domain, and his works are perceived as strong. In addition to therapy, he is an expert diagonostician, and giver of prophylaxis. Finally, the debtera ’s medical powers are perceived as only an aspect of the more general powers he possesses, and which he displays in various non-medical works affecting property, interpersonal relations, and, importantly, the sending of illness.

The secular healer (particularly the medhaniyt awakiy ) is reluctant to part with professional knowledge, even when a reasonable price is offered. Unlike the abinet capital of debtera s, medical capital dissipates as it is “spent”. ... [contrasts this system to the collaborative nature of debtera knowledge sharing] ... the professional reputation of the lay healer is tied to a specific ailment, just as he himself is tied to a specific locality, as the sedentary cultivator of ambilineage fields. Since a layman’s medical reputation is fixed in space, potential purchasers of his medical knowledge are drawn from among his potential clients. Thus, by sharing his medical knowledge with another secular healer, the lay practitioner establishes a potential rival and dilutes the economic and social advantages of his practice.

While out playing, ten year old Tesfahun and two companions were bitten by a dog. After they returned to their ward, Tesfahun told his mother, Berey, what had happened; and the woman took him to a nearby stream. She directed him to wade into it, so that he would not develop the fear of water that is characteristic of the later stages of rabies ( yimatfow wuw[unknown]sa ba[unknown]siyta ), when the introjected dog-like spirit agent begins to make its hydrophobic presence felt. In her village there lived a yimatfow wuw[unknown]sa ba[unknown]siyta medhaniyt seci . From this herbalist, Berey received a root with the directions that, once it had been ground and mixed with water, it must be immediately consumed or would loose its potency. On the next day, before she had an opportunity to prepare the infusion, Berey fell into a conversation with a neighbor regarding the previous day’s happenings. The neighbor, a Muslim, remarked that a fukura (here, a Muslim healer analogous to a “weak” debtera ) living in another ward was famous for his ability to treat rabies. Tesfahun was taken to the fukura , who commanded him to undress and gaze into the practitioner’s mirror. While the boy stared at it, the fukura , who was a blind man, did likewise. [Page 241] After a minute, the practitioner declared that Tesfahun had not contracted the ailment. The fukura was was paid E$1., and Tesfahun was given no therapy. His companions were later taken to this practitioner, who after diagnosis indicated that both had contracted rabies, and required therapy. None of the participants attempted to obtain an explanation for this epidemiological pattern. This consisted of herbals mixed with the milk of a cow nursing a calf of its own color. The infusion was a violent purgative, and a memele[unknown]sa permitted its safe application until blood had appeared in the evacuae. This was taken as a sign that the disease substance had been destroyed and was being eliminated. Although all of this had taken place within one week of the dog’s attack, the principals were aware that the ailment can be treated successfully within four weeks of an attack. After that time, no therapy, however powerful it may be, can succeed. The fukura sold his therapy at the of E$10. for each boy. Although the fee was paid on receipt of therapy, this was not necessary; the payment could have been made to a third party (a gwadeña of the client), who would then transmit the money to the therapist once the therapy had proven itself effective.

When Ndawula [an old king] grew old, he caught an eye disease which baffled all the doctors. At long last, there came a man who told the king that he was a specialist in eye diseases. “But once I give you my medicine”, he claimed, “you must hide in the forest so that people may not see you. If they see you, your eyes will not get cured. If, however, someone meets you, you must forbid him to let anyone else know. Should he fail to keep your whereabouts secret, he must be brought before you tied on a rope, and as soon as you see him, he should be killed at once. If you fulfil all these conditions, your eyes will get completely cured.” After Ndawula had conferred with his mother, his maternal uncle and his prime minister, he set off with the doctor. They went and hid in Nawanku forest which was on Mengo hill. He was treated only for a few days and the disease got cured. As soon as he had recovered his sight, he began to walk along the borders of the forest and the banana gardens. But one day, he met a man called Siroganga, who was going to hunt. The king asked him not to report him, and Siroganga assured him that he would not.

In effect the normal protection of all pregnant beings is reversed in an attempt to reverse widespread unpregnancy. There is a shift in emphasis in this festival from the women's ritual of rebellion against the elders to a ritual reversal shared by both sexes and the notion of purification in a matter that poses a threat to the whole community. It would only be contemplated when forces destroying reproductivity are already felt to be rampant. These have to be met with a sorcerous act of similar magnitude, after close consultation with the Prophet as an expert in sorcery. It is comparable with the heinous act of installing the ritual leader at eunoto from which others that have a close sympathy with the victim stand to benefit.

All savage races have their medicine men, and the Somali is no exception. Among the members of most of the tribes will be recognized surgical experts whose methods, although somewhat rough and ready, are often most ingenious.
It is well-nigh impossible to witness a Somali surgeon operating, so one can only judge by the results, which, after all is said and done, are the workman’s best test, and these are very frequently highly creditable, if not excellent.
Both the surgical and medical treatment of any case is almost invariably accompanied by the slaughter of a fat sheep or camel, the flesh of the latter animal, in particular, being credited with the most beneficial effects on patients, especially those recovering from some prolonged illness. The effect of a camel feast in Somaliland might favourably compare with the results derived from a visit to Lourdes, such great faith have the Somalis in the strengthening and healing properties of the flesh of this odorous beast!
Faith, indeed, has to play as great a part in the Somali country as elsewhere in more civilized countries.
They have far greater faith in their own simple remedies than in any of the drugs of civilization, with the possible exception of sulphur and the liniment of iodine.
The marvellous recuperative powers of the Somali, together with the beneficial effects of a clear dry atmosphere and the sterilizing effect of the sun, have [Page 157] to answer for the rapid healing of wounds, provided they are kept well cleaned; in no country with which I am acquainted is there less need of antiseptics.

The expert himself supplies the patient with those plants or parts of plants that are needed in the treatment. If they require any form of preparation or extraction he will see to that too. The administration of the cure is also supervised by the herbalist. If repeated administration is necessary, the herbalist will usually stay overnight at the patient’s home or return there with the medicine when it is time. If he asks a direct question, the patient will usually be told the name of the plant being administered. However, experts will not volunteer such information and they frequently attempt to conceal the exact method of preparation.

It may well be that the varying efficacy ascribed to these different forms of medication is related to their availability. Whereas kiniin is usually available from any countryside shop, kabsuls tend to be obtainable only from pharmacies. Finally, erbad is almost exclusively administered by specialists. Though I have never heard it explicitly said, it would appear that those medicines that are most difficult to obtain are considered to be the most powerful.
There exists concerning daawo therapy both a lay knowledge and expert controlled skills. The experts are pharmacists or people with some form of government health training, such as community health workers. There are many free-lance “doctors” with a background in the colonial health service or without any form of education. In district centers there are dispensaries and in several regional centers there are clinics with access to foreign doctors.
These different types of experts are not equally appreciated, although the term dakhtar is often used for anybody associated with daawo . The foremost treatment is held to be that offered by foreigners. An example is that when a TB clinic, staffed by a Finnish medical team, was to be opened in the town Baydhabo, the rumour of this quickly spread in the countryside. Long before the clinic had opened, every morning outside its gates there was a crowd of patients claiming to suffer from a variety of ailments. [Page 115] In the same way foreign veterinarians may be consulted for purely human diseases. I myself have also been consulted for the most varied symptoms. My medicines appeared to be particularly attractive although they had often been purchased from local pharmacies.

Concerning the treatments based on tablets, capsules and injections, daawo, it was established that this type of medicine is often seen as connected to foreigners in the sense of non-Muslims and non-Somalis. I also showed that that there is a tendency to favour experts who are foreigners themselves or who are believed to have received their knowledge from foreigners. The distinction between the knowledge of infidels and the knowledge of Muslims is also given a cosmological correspondence in the “this world/next world” doctrine. Medicine in itself is seen as particularly powerful if it has come from abroad and, in pharmacies, the country of origin may be of considerable importance in the choice between different medicines. It was also said to be an advantage if the medicine is accompanied by instructions in some foreign language. Foreigners as such, however, are not seen as intrinsically good; rather they belong to a category of people in which one can also expect to find enemies.

Girls are infibulated about the age of puberty—between eleven and thirteen years of age—but sometimes earlier, the vulva being scarified and then drawn together and held until its sides have knit together but for a small orifice. This is done usually by a woman who belongs to a specialist occupational group of low status. A portion of the clitoris is also excised to make the girl clean ( [unknown]halaal ) in a Muslim sense. The operation is usually performed individually and without much ceremonial. The object is to prepare a girl for marriage and to safeguard her virginity until that time. The excision of part of the clitoris may be made separately at a more tender age. See de Villeneuve 1937.

Before the former sheikh of that tribal segment died (he was Muftah’s uncle), one member of the group got into an argument with the police officer in charge of the police station in the district. The tribesman insulted the police officer who insisted on arresting him. Rumors also had it that the police officer was using his authority to reduce the share of the tribal segment in the government aid which was badly needed during that particular year. Sheikh Muftah, whose father is the Aquila of [Page 100] bait Mughaieb of the Sanagrah tribe, went to the officer and apologized to him on behalf of the whole group and invited him to a lavish dinner party. The charges against the tribesman were soon dropped, and it was concluded that it was because of the way Muftah had handled the situation. Since that incident, Muftah has been known as an expert in handling the government officials. One year later, the sheikh of the tribal segment died, and a meeting was held during which the important members of the Sanagrah tribal segment in the district decided to nominate Muftah for the position of the sheikh, vacant by the death of his uncle. Muftah, who was attending the meeting, was asked to accept the nomination, and he agreed. “...I accepted the nomination reluctantly.” Muftah later told me, “I did not really want to become the sheikh. The position does not bring any personal benefit, and it involves a lot of responsibility. The sheikh has to act as an attorney for his tribe, represent it to the government and competes with other sheikhs to bring his people things that the other sheikhs cannot get for theirs, like more membership in the cooperative units or in the socialist union. And what does he get in return? Nothing...not even the gratitude of his people. To them, he is a servant of the tribe, and his duty is to look after its interest. If he doesn’t, then everybody is quick to criticize him. I had to accept the nomination because I felt it was my duty to do so and not to embarrass the awaqil and the important people of the tribe who put their confidence in me. As far as the government, all I get is six pounds a month.”

A girl may have little intellectual understanding of what is being done at the time of her chisungu [intitiation ritual], although she may be in a highly emotional state in which she is likely to be suggestible to the general emphasis laid on the importance of marriage and childbirth. Next year however she will act as a young helper of the nacimbusa and so her knowledge will grow. As one old nacimbusa put it ‘If she has seen two ceremonies, or three, a girl will come to me and say “Tell me about the crocodile”. She remembers and then she comes and asks me again “Tell me some more about the crocodile” and I tell her more. But other girls have no ears. They do not ask anything. They just say “Let it be, those are things of the chisungu” ’. In other words, clever girls begin to memorize and get more and more knowledge of the deeper associations of the symbols and these girls probably become specialist banacimbusa [teachers] as they grow older. The others, no doubt, give up when they find they cannot master the intricacies of the ceremonial.

Leeches and diviners are among the most common important specialists of Lozi society. Many of them are Old Mbunda and Wiko. The longer I lived among the Lozi the more I felt that almost everyone was skilled in treating some disease. Certain of them are well known over wide areas.
Should a Lozi suffer a misfortune, he is likely to resort to a diviner to detect the cause. Some of these causes I have already mentioned: royal spirits, sorcerers, the ancestors. But many diseases are almost personified by the Lozi and are commonly divined: liyala, maimbwe, mabamba, sisongo, muba , and others. Some of these diseases are more clearly associated with demons; thus muba is related to mwendandjangula and mwenda-lutaka , demons of the bush and the Plain respectively, which have half of human bodies and are fiery red. They are of both sexes. Should one of these spirits desire a man or woman, it will try to kidnap him or her, and can at least strike with severe illness. In all these diseases the treatment aims to produce, by smoking, drumming, and singing, hysteric symptoms: violent jerkings of the body in a state of seeming trance. When a patient is being treated, kin and neighbours come to attend. The drumming wakens the disease in all of them who have been ill of it before and they too will join in the violent dance of the sufferer. The disease links together all sufferers, and anyone who recovers from a severe attack has to become a leech treating it.

I do not have information from analysis of the active principles and properties present in the treatments prescribed for specific symptoms although I have lists of such prescriptions for Bulozi and there are published lists for two neighbouring areas sharing basically the same botanical resources as Bulozi. Simply to look at the lists and prescriptions is to gain two impressions. Firstly, they would not have been recoverably in this form if much of it had not worked; secondly, with no notion of dosage, the risk of failure even if the active principle was right was thereby increased. But here, as in those cases for which the prescription was wrong, there was a sequential series of blocks to falsifiability: if the specific treatment failed, this would be a sign that the affliction was not simple and it therefore required specialist treatment. If the healer's specifics failed, this was a sign of evil interference which had to be identified by divination, and in this way a structural block could be invoked, even if the patient died. Thus a difficult case would move along one axis of the table from individual to communal and the other from symptomatic to non-symptomatic treatment, hence diagonally. The line could be extended off the table since for affliction beyond the norm, such as the early 1890s smallpox epidemic, recourse could only be through appeal to the unseen powers and there divinatory practice merged with the other functions of the royal graves.

It is to be emphasized that the mere possession of a needle as a protective charm does not enable the wearer to project siposo . Projection is a highly skilled and dangerous affair for the witchdoctor or sorcerer who employs it; should the attack be parried, the missile returns to harm the sender. He must, therefore, wear needle charms, [Page 41] or perhaps ngoba beads, as a defence in case of failure. The ngoba , which are an assortment of actual Venetian and other beads and carved pieces of root, are usually worn as a bracelet (Fig. 6(a), (b) and (c)) and are only to be found in the possession of a siposo expert. Their possession is proof positive of deep knowledge of, and great skill in siposo matters. The owner may be either a sorcerer or witchdoctor.

This wide separation of the two professions [witchdoctor and herbal specialist] has no counterpart in a central African environment. They are closely allied and, in many situations, no sharp distinction can be drawn between them. Both kinds of doctor are called ng'aka, a strong indication of the proximity of their relationship in African eyes. This is not to say that the African does not recognize the differences between them. Any reasonably intelligent villager can explain that while the one deals directly with a malady using herbal and other medicines, the other, where witchcraft is diagnosed, cures the patient by parrying, by defeating and, if necessary, by killing the witch or sorcerer. The leech may give the patient a charm to wear or slip a needle under his skin, as a defence against magical attacks, but he is not thereby considered a witchdoctor. Because he recognizes that a particular illness is caused by a member of the spirit world, it does not mean that he considers that spirit a witch or a sorcerer. Perhaps one may obtain the best perspective if one considers the witchdoctor as a kind of specialist dealing only with those troubles, not necessarily medical, caused by witches or by sorcerers. Just as the specialist is a superior [Page 49] doctor, so the doctor of witchcraft, ng'aka ya buloi , is a superior ng'aka . He is indeed colloquially known as a ‘big’ doctor and is considered to be much more skilled and experienced than is his herbal counterpart....
The ng'aka , therefore, is employed where a malady or misfortune is caused by something mysterious and inexplicable to ordinary people. He is consulted only on the advice of a diviner though, as is explained later, he may himself be the diviner. Each lay specialist usually knows but a few remedies or charms. The ng'aka , however, unless he is a ‘small’ doctor able to treat only a limited number of ailments, as often are doctors of muba or of sisongo , is considered able to cure all those maladies that are treated by the lay specialist. His fees are, of course, much higher, and it is understandable that, wherever possible, a man avails himself in the first instance of the services of the layman.

The witchdoctor, as befits a man who is a specialist, often rises from the ranks of the herbal doctors. Frequently, however, a layman may feel constrained to join this specialized branch of doctoring and so by-passes, and perhaps completely ignores his less spectacular, more humble colleagues, though when he falls ill of an ordinary complaint he has to place himself in their hands. One such case involved a herbal doctor who cured a witchdoctor of a kaliloze bullet wound in the leg. The gun used was of the modern variety.
The tendency to specialize, found among European scientists and medical men, has its counterpart among the Bantu. Just as the witchdoctor is a specialist among doctors, so is the sikuyeti doctor a specialist among witchdoctors, The difference would appear to be that whereas the ordinary witchdoctor is content, where possible, to remove the evil influence from his patient and to foil or expose the muloi , the sikuyeti doctor is much more ruthless; his aim is the destruction of the offending muloi . Some baloi are too powerful for the ordinary witchdoctor to tackle; the sikuyeti doctor, however, is able to trap and kill even the cleverest. The kaliloze doctor, it would appear is, for the lunda-luvale , what the sikuyeti doctor is for the luyana.

It might be argued from the use of the term, ng'aka wa pula , that the raindoctor is but a specialist ng'aka and should be included in Chapter III. Informants agree, however, that raindoctoring is a distinctly separate practice and should be described accordingly in a chapter of its own. The confusion as to whether or not a sitondo is an ng'aka arises from the fact that most, if not all sitondo are able to treat injuries caused by lightning. By so doing they become herbal doctors and, therefore, ng'aka proper. Should they restrict their activities to rain and lightning direction, they are merely sitondo.

Chastising a girl for promiscuity is the duty of the father, for while a daughter spends more time with her mother than her father, any disgrace caused by a daughter must be born equally by the father. Punishment for promiscuity is beating, or turning the girl out of the house naked (cf. Cruickshank, v. II, p. 209). Deterrants to prevent the continuance of indiscretions are forcing the girl to douche with a solution of pepper and ginger, or making her drink a mixture supplied by a priest or medical practitioner, and telling her a god (obosom) will punish her if she persists in misbehaving.

Onset about six months ago when he fainted while standing in a drill-parade during a teacher-training course. He became rapidly worse, was delirious, violent and attacked people with a cutlass. He was admitted to a Kumasi hospital, where a course of injections was started, but the relatives removed him against medical advice, believing the illness supernaturally caused. He went then to his uncle's “village” where he was treated by native practitioners. He became worse: the mother describes epileptiform fits. The uncle then decided that the illness was caused by the mother's witchcraft and brought him a great distance to the village where I found him, telling the medicine-man that if the mother came near the patient, he (the uncle) would wash his hands of the whole matter. The patient did not improve and became unable to talk.

The adwumfo, in the present context goldsmiths ( adwini is any skilled work in gold, silver, or leather), were in ancient time an honoured class. All goldsmiths formed a sort of brotherhood, and any goldsmith had the privilege of calling a fellow-goldsmith's wife ‘my wife’, 1 and they were privileged to wear gold ornaments, a form of personal adornment otherwise rigorously restricted to kings, their wives, and the greater chiefs. In the Bekwai administrative division of Ashanti all the goldsmiths trace their origin to one Fusu Kwebi, the first of their trade. The bellows and a few of the weights and tools of this now almost divine ancestor are still preserved, and along with his obosom (god), Ta Yao, have become the goldsmith's particular god (see Fig. 111). His cult has even extended beyond the goldsmiths' guild, and his god (one of Tano's many ‘sons’) is now consulted by others who are not in the trade. The ancient bellows, now only a crumbling piece of wood with the skin long since rotted away, are resorted to by wives who are accused of unfaithfulness who wish to attest their innocence, by drinking wine that has been allowed to flow over this fragment.

Childlessness is attributed to two main causes. The first is premarital laxity on the woman's part; the second is an incompatibility of the different types of ‘blood’ (semen) of the man and the vaginal secretion. ‘Many native doctors claim to have medicines, mostly of a magical kind’, for correcting the latter and ‘inducing pregnancy and successful practitioners soon become very wealthy’.

In Asante it is women who are the knowledgeable genealogists, doubtless because it is through them that descent is reckoned. In 1965 I was able to talk with the elderly Nana Yaa Kyaa of Akorase, a great-great-granddaughter of Akyaawa. True to form, she was able to narrate the intricate ramifications of her family history.

The teaching of the sigi so [sacred and secret language, used for ritual]. The elders teach it to the young postulants for the Society of the Masks on the occasion of a dama or a Sigi. There are, moreover, specialists for this teaching, to whom it is necessary to pay “thirty-three thousand and three cowries” (an expression meaning a very substantial sum) in order to become their pupil. Few Dogon seem to have a profound knowledge of the sigi so.
The teaching is preceded by special rites: master and pupil must drink from the same calabash a mixture of beer, oil of sesame, and pediñe (previously crushed). A little of this mixture is then poured into the auditory canal of the pupil, in order that he may have “good ears.”
The teaching properly speaking starts with very simple phrases including the enumeration of different degrees of kinship and some salutations. The vocabulary is learned in a precise order: food, drink, parts of the body (starting with the head), facts relating to the Imina na, the rhombos, etc.

There is little known about Laya's childhood. After 1949 he was secretary to Ogobara who then became “canton chief” and was his inseparable attendant, his mouthpiece, his tool, and admirer — a petit frère who regarded it as his life's work to help his grand frère carry on his administrative duties. During their joint travels on official business, Laya was said to have been particularly attentive toward the sick and injured. Through his connection with Dogon priests and marabouts who were skilled in the art of healing, he was given medicines, and he even brought about miraculous cures. When, as a result of a different political structure, Ogobara was no longer “canton chief” (1958), the village secretary was obliged to look for other occupations. He went to Bandiagara and in the hospital there began a course in male nursing. He lives there in the family house and provides for his two wives and his children who have stayed with Ogobara's family in Sanga.

Both are simple budgets, self-explanatory and severely limited to the essentials for Hausa rural living standards. The contrast between them centres on farming. No. 84, a stranger to G, had no farms in 1949 and his gross income is 92 per cent. cash, whereas no. 22, a native of B, farms vigorously but has a low cash income. Of 22’s earnings as a herbal specialist in curing syphilis, nothing unfortunately is known.

Although they [the community] were poor, Gauranga came to prize them, and on Friday he would slaughter as many as ten cows and then distribute the meat as alms to the Hausa. One reason for his generosity was his reliance upon their leaders for various ritual practices. Their mallamai were expert in hisabi and larabi, numerology and soothsaying, and he regularly consulted at least four men among the strangers. 63 The Dassinawa had also established four schools for their own children, but the local inhabitants began to attend them once the teachers learned sufficient Arabic or Barma. In addition to this elementary education, there were mallamai capable of [Page 38] teaching such disciplines as hadisi, shari’a, and tauhidi —tradition, law, and theology.

Beyond these traditional interpretations of malanta lie related activities and specializations. One of the most prevalent in Chad is that of the counselor (or fortune teller, charm maker, or wonder-worker), in which various mallamai employ particular aspects of their learning in explaining or influencing the supernatural. Some are experts in the interpretation of dreams, while others cast horoscopes, advise on journeys, or make charms to ensure success. The distinction between the mallam and his non-Islamic counterpart, the herbalist, becomes obscure when the former employs “medicine” in addition to prayers, invocations, and the preparation of charms or a drink which he makes from ink when he washes off his writing board. Although these wonder-working mallamai are represented in several Chadian ethnic [Page 155] groups, those among the pilgrims enjoy a higher prestige than their fellows.

Modu prayed at least several hours a day until the wedding night, but to no avail. He later admitted to intimate household members that he was at first unable to reach an erection. Therefore, in the middle of the night, he visited a senior medicine specialist in the village. This worthy told him that no one could ever impregnate this particular young girl because he, the medicine man, had “closed her up” for Ali when Ali had been rejected as her first husband. The matter was now closed and for a small fee he would “open her” again. He gave the anxious groom some medicine and Modu returned and consummated his marriage successfully.
In the cases of impotence over the same girl described above, both men knew there was a history of “bad feeling” over this girl. The possibility that malevolence might be involved was very much enhanced in such an atmosphere. Thus the normal anxiety over the semi-public display of one’s manhood was heightened by the knowledge that someone had in fact not wanted this marriage to take place—and might have done something supernatural to prevent it. In such a charged climate, two successive cases of impotency are not surprising, and the medicine specialist did well to calm things down by admitting to the reality of the malevolence. Indeed, in taking credit for it, he created and enhanced his credibility to the point where he could believably withdraw the “spell.”

He was anxious about the gift and so went to an expert on medicines who gave him a couple of special kola nuts whose magical love potion power would direct the woman to find him irresistible. His confidence thus buoyed up, he visited her himself and they had a short affair. He tasted her cooking, observed her behavior, and after two weeks sent a friend to the older brother to arrange for the marriage payments. Three weeks later, after the marriage was proposed to the luwali, (in this case her older brother), the couple were married.

When the infant arrives it is washed, then warmed almost continuously by the women in attendance who heat their hands over a dish of hot coals and then press the body of the child gently. Almost immediately there are attempts to have the child feed at the mother’s breast. At the same time the placenta is buried in the compound with no ceremony. If it fails to descend, one of the women in attendance hastens to a local religious practitioner or a medicinal expert who gives medicines to bring it down. All adult men, including the husband, are barred from any direct participation in the birth event. Instead they usually pray during the entire birth along with their friends and a religious practitioner who may have been hired especially for this purpose.

The butcher’s craft, although lucrative in relation to other activities like Ka’anami’s or blacksmithing, is a low status occupation, and many butchers including Mala Bukar are quick to say that [Page 84] their families were not butchers in times past but conditions have forced them to “take up the knife.” The craft requires anatomical knowledge of animals and a skilled use of the knife to cut and clean them. Besides this it necessitates continuous relations with cattle owners, many of whom are Shuwa and Fulani nomads who wander through the area.

The practice of medicine is closely associated with magic, but just as not every mishap is due to a supernatural cause, so not every medicine is a magic medicine. Medicines are divided into three classes: First, there are a few simples [sic] which can be used by anybody without formality, as for instance the alufu grass (see p. 35) used for stopping bleeding. These are called ‘sword medicine’ ( icigh ki shmough ). Secondly, there are some which must be ‘bought’, but are not connected with an akombo , such as certain herbs used to cure gonorrhoea. The third kind, and far the biggest, are the akombo medicines. These can only be applied by a man who has control of the particular akombo to which they belong, but even when he has been fully initiated he must pay a further fee for the right to administer them. This classification, however, is not based entirely on the type of medicine or treatment employed, but also depends to some extent on the nature of the disease and the circumstances in which it was contracted. Even the herbs in the first class can only be applied without original payment of a fee if used as a cure for simple cuts or wounds which a man may get accidentally in the course of his normal avocations. They cannot so be used in connexion with an operation like circumcision. In this case, as seen in the first chapter, the practitioner must buy the right, not only to perform the operation, but also to give the prescribed after-treatment, even though this may consist merely in the application of remedies which at other times he is in the habit of using without any such restrictions.
Thus for every akombo right, and for every kind of medical or 210 surgical treatment, except a few ‘household’ remedies in everyday use, there is a fee laid down, both that which the patient must pay the doctor and also that which the doctor must pay for the right to practise. This fee must be paid to ensure success, whether the treatment is purely pathological or whether it is wholly or partly magical. But there is an important distinction between ‘natural’ and ‘supernatural’ treatment (using the words in a European sense) with regard to the initial qualifications of the practitioner. The right to do operations, such as circumcision or teeth-cutting, and to use the non-magical medicines mentioned in the second category, has only to be bought ( yam ), but no man may perform the magic rites or apply the herbs or treatment of the third category unless he has obtained control ( k[unknown]r ) or the particular akombo concerned by undergoing initiation. It is held by some of the Tiv, probably correctly, that the latter class of treatments is indigenous, whereas those which need only be bought have been copied from other peoples in comparatively recent times. It should, however, be emphasized that in every department of life, and more especially in the practice of medicine, the line between the natural and the supernatural is very faintly drawn, and that even in the case of those treatments and operations which have no especial magical significance in themselves, the unseen forces are felt to be very near at hand, waiting for a chance to make things go wrong. For this reason, no important operation is undertaken, or treatment applied, without every precaution being taken against their intervention.

The akombo igbo is performed as follows:--The practitioner is called and he makes the igbo, some six pieces of grass folded over at the ends, into a bundle about a foot long and places it on the ground near a stone. He then takes a chicken and touches the stone, the igbo, and the woman (on the chest and back) with it, and then twirls it round her head six times. Then he kills the chicken by cutting its throat and puts blood on the stone, on the igbo, and on the woman’s navel. The chicken is then cooked and brought with yam food (ruam) and the practitioner takes a morsel of yam food, and the legs and head of the chicken, and puts morsels on the stone and on the igbo. Then he throws a morsel east saying ‘iyange wan nomso’ (the sun is a young man), and a morsel west saying ‘uwer wan kwase’ (the moon is a young woman), after which he takes a morsel and puts it to the woman’s lips and, taking it away, feeds it to a male, not her husband. The practitioner then pours out a mixture of flour and water (mwem) on the stone and on the igbo and then puts the igbo in the roof of the woman’s hut and the ceremony is at an end.”
“The akombo a gbande is nearly always performed for a woman with child; this is a ceremony for the expulsion of evil and is carried out as follows:--The woman kneels on one knee in front of the practitioner, and a ram or male goat is taken by him and he touches her breast with it, each time repeating one of the following formula:--...

“The other important akombo performed for women with child is called the akombo swende. It is an act for the expulsion of evil and the transference of it into the body of a scape-goat. It is always performed by a male slave who must always disappear immediately afterwards; some say that he was driven away in the past. It is performed as follows:--A male slave is called, who is a practitioner of the akombo, and he takes a cock, a dog, a piece of iron and a pot of gruel which no woman must have touched.
He goes down with these to a stream, the woman following. The woman stands in the stream, up stream, and the slave ties a string round her neck and another round her waist. He places a leaf of wild pawpaw (hur) on either bank, puts mud on them and pours gruel on them. Then he takes the cock and leaf in his right hand, and another leaf in his left, and touches the leaves on either bank with these. Then he touches the woman on the chest and back with them and twirls the cock round her head saying:--(I am performing the rites of Swende to-day for you; in case you have touched a man killed by accident; in case you have talked with a Swende practitioner; or in case you have killed a dog or stepped over a dog’s bone). He then stoops and splashes water down stream with the chicken and leaves, saying ‘ibo sen, ibo sen’, (evil flow away, evil flow away); then turning and splashing towards the woman he says:--‘isho kondo, isho kondo’ (virtue flow up, virtue flow up). He then kills the cock by dashing its head on a stone and, taking out the crop, puts in on the leaf on the right bank. Then he kills the dog by dashing its head on the stone and throws away the body to flow away on the water, or, if the stream is nearly dry, into the bush. He then takes mud from the stream and puts it on the woman’s navel, cuts the strings and throws them in the stream. Finally he takes water from the stream in the leaf and sprinkles the woman, and the akombo is at an end. The slave must go away as quickly as possible; if he should enter the compound of the woman disaster is said to be certain.

There is another aspect of the continuity of akombo : namely, the notion that they are regarded as a progression to the good things of life. Reference here is to what has been called in the literature akombo biamegh and po’or. Biamegh is a grand ceremony that will involve not only one’s kin, or only the clan, but the entire Tiv land. When biamegh is celebrated (very rarely, for the expense is great), akombo specialists from all over the land will come to the place where it is being held, and the proceedings are likely to last for several days. Po’or is the name given to a bin in which, according to the old lore, human heads were kept. Again there are big rites connected with it. Both biamegh and po’or are what the Tiv call akombo-a-tamen (‘great’ akombo ), which directly involve social groups and not individuals, and are concerned with such matters as possession of land, not with illness. The ramifications involved are complicated, and the writer is not equipped to go into them. 1 The point to be made here is that there is a positive notion of continuity with the other akombo. Biamegh and po’or are looked upon as extensions which cannot be entered until all the other akombo are completed by an individual or by his father in the way that has been described. With these two ‘great’ akombo we are moving away from pure ‘disease’ to questions of social control. In fact one akombo specialist, in contradistinction to other akombo specialists and to the literature, did not consider biamegh and po’or to be akombo at all. Akombo, he said, meant ‘sickness’, but biamegh had to do with good clothes and enjoyment, property and so on—good things generally. The merging of concepts of disease with others concerning acquisition of property, status, and control is a complexity that would take much further research to unravel. Some general line of progression, however, is quite clear.

Wolof women, however, do not always compete in the socially accepted fashion. When a wife finds that another is surpassing her in her husband’s affection, she may resort to magic, much of which is malicious and is disapproved of by the community. Jealous wives go to a practitioner of magic ( wanyankat) who uses pagan techniques, to have him work a form of magic called n[unknown]t[unknown]l designed to make it impossible for the rival to remain in one place for any length of time, and thus cause her to leave the village. The practitioner of magic ties a charm on the foot of a vulture to make the victim travel whenever the bird flies somewhere. A socially accepted charm called baire is commonly worn to win the love of husbands and to eliminate competition. This contains either a verse of the Koran, called alam nasara laka, 16 or a powder made of ground herbs which is pagan magic. But most of the magic is illicit and distinctly malevolent: There are medicines which cause the [Page 122] rival to divorce the husband, which prevent her from having children, make her ill, or even bring about her death. One called dedeli (to separate) destroys the love of the husband for her. A woman about to be married to a man who already has a spouse is said to practice magic against her future cowife; and a bride takes precautions against the evil machinations of the first wife or other wives. The more violent forms of black magic, especially frowned on by pious Mohammedans, are probably not much used. However, they are well known and precautions are taken against them to be on the safe side. Most of the use of magic by the women seems to have the beneficial effect of giving vent to stored-up resentments without doing much actual harm.

Certain natives, served by a good memory and a livelier intelligence, took an interest in these traditions and legends to the extent of learning those of /120/ neighboring families and even of neighboring kingdoms and little by little acquired a reputation as specialists in these matters. Fara Penda was one of them, and even today Yoro Dyâo, who has inherited this same reputation, speaks only with veneration about the knowledge of his father. The knowledge of French that he acquired at the School for Hostages enabled Yoro to take notes on his father’s narrations and later on those of the griots and the old men to whose narrations he listened. It was with the help of these notes, and for the sole purpose of preserving his recollections for himself, that he drew up the two notebooks that follow, without imagining that they might one day be published. We thank him for being willing to entrust them to us and to give us the supplementary information that seemed to us necessary for understanding them.

Among the Wolof, most of the occasions when distant ancestors or matrilateral ties are discussed involve genealogical specialists from the griot caste (the gewel). Remembering the more complicated aspects of genealogy is supposed to be the griot’s responsibility. Some few non- griot elders, male and female, can produce partial genealogies for their own families, or they may offer an opinion on a griot’s performance. But these elders are invariably weak on matrilateral ties, and they are likely to disclaim responsibility for knowing or for recounting the more distant relationships. When nobles do discuss genealogy among themselves, the discussion is usually limited to fairly close relationships among living individuals, in which the genealogical background is not more than two or three generations deep. The kind of discussion Blount reports for the Luo-a discussion among elders concerning distant relationships among their own families-does not occur here.
There are two kinds of occasions when griots present historical information: formal recital (called woy, or praise singing) and informal conversation ( waxtan). 7 There are several differences between the two events. First, praise singing is the exclusive prerogative of the gewel, a special service for which they can demand immediate public payment. Second, the two events differ as to whether the genealogy is presented in formal or informal manner. The formality of praise singing consists mainly in the style of delivery and the application of certain structural conventions. Praise-songs usually include some passages whose text is fixed and learned by heart, but fixity of text is not the main criterion distinguishing formal from informal testimony, for such passages are not the most important part of the recital and can be deleted.
The scheduling and setting of the two speech events tend to differ also. There is no particular moment that is better than any other for informal conversation about genealogies, except that people are most likely to want to discuss genealogy when they are contemplating a marriage, considering litigation that involves genealogical claims, or asking for financial assistance or political support on grounds of kinship. The conversation usually occurs inside the hut or room of the person whose genealogy is being discussed. The occasion is quite private, and other griots are not likely to attend.
In contrast, formal praise singing usually takes place in more public settings and in scheduled, large-scale events. The most usual occasion for praise singing is a feast that someone has sponsored for an important family event or for one of the Muslim holidays. These feasts, to which the village at large and many people from surrounding villages are invited, are important in maintaining the reputation of the host as a person of wealth, generosity, and pride in his family. The feasts are also opportunities for outsiders to visit a village, see and hear evidence of the host’s family background, and propose a marital alliance. The recital of praise-songs affirms the host’s generosity toward his griot dependents (who display the cash they have been given as they sing), while it celebrates his genealogical claims.
Another difference between the two speech events is their availability and frequency. Because conversation about genealogies takes place in private, whereas praise singing occurs in public, any Wolof villager may witness most of the praise-songs but only a few of the conversations. In particular, the younger griots who are still learning the historical information [Page 657] attend many public praise-songs-almost every day, at the height of the season-but they rarely attend informal conversations on genealogy with non- griots, because only older griots qualify as “experts.” Praise singing is also more frequent, because many griots prefer it. A griot summoned for a private, informal talk, when he arrives may launch into a formal performance instead. (Although praise singing is normally associated with feasts, special settings are not actually a prerequisite. Griots can decide to perform anywhere, even in a private room. That the griot begins to perform in the formal style is sufficient to define the event as praise singing.)
Finally, the two speech events differ in the kind of discourse that can occur in them. Although I will examine discourse in both events, I must note from the outset that the formal event probably has greater significance for the transmission of historical tradition because of its frequency and its accessibility to the younger generation of griots.

As a result, the interests of the Wolof performer are not identical with the interests of the individual who is the subject of the genealogical discourse (his patron), as they might be in a society where genealogy is recounted by a political contender himself (as among the Tiv and the Luo). Rather, the griot has his own reputation to promote as well, and other patrons to attract. If a griot wants to ensure that his performance for one patron does not alienate others who may be present in the audience, his willingness to distort a genealogy in that person’s favor may be much reduced. And at the same time there is a definite advantage to be gained from presenting a detailed, clear, and convincing genealogy, for the griot’s personal and professional reputation rests largely on whether he is considerd to be truthful and knowledgeable. Such griots are thought to be morally superior to others, and they command the highest fees and the greatest number of patrons because whatever genealogical claims they make for a patron are more likely to be believed.... 
Still another consequence seems to be a pressure on the griot to avoid telling lies, and to confine his manipulations of the pedigree to exploiting ambiguities, tracing only desirable lines, and omitting undesirable materials. Comparison of genealogies given by different griots and comments made by other informants suggest that, indeed, actual alteration of specific detail is rare compared to other ways of casting genealogies to someone’s advantage. Contradictions are few.

The Wolof make use of most available medication and medical practitioners–modern, Muslim, or traditional. Nearly all Wolof wear numerous amulets that are believed to have the power to protect the wearer from illness, evil spirits, witchcraft, or other harm. The most common function of marabouts at the village level is to make these amulets, which consist of passages from the Quran written on slips of paper encased in leather packets. The shaman (jabarkat) may also be hired to make amulets, in which case the leather casings contain pieces of magical roots or leaves.

One also finds, as in all other Buddhist lands, bonzesses living together in convents not far from the pagodas where they are forbidden to reside. Like the bonzes, they are supposed to remain continent during their stay in the bonzeries, and the penalty of death awaits those who give birth to children. For this reason, it is maintained, they are greatly skilled in the infamous art of abortion. Their morals have the reputation of being abominable. For the rest, bonzes and bonzesses are perfectly free to leave their convents and monasteries whenever they wish and return to public life, and this is a very frequent occurrence. People enter these hostels because they do not know what else to do, and if they grow tired of the life after a more or less long stay, they leave and go to seek their fortune elsewhere.

Besides women of these lower orders there are others that never cover the face and who, although entirely respectable, may be seen by men without reproach. These are, lady physicians, of whom there are many in Korea, and the blind female exorcists. Women of the upper middle class or even of the highest class may enter the medical profession and if so they are exempt from the restrictions which hedge in their sisters. It is said that many Korean female doctors are very expert at acupuncture which is about all the surgery of which the Esculapian art can boast in Korea.

Besides the medical cures, the people also resort to lay practitioners with special reputations for curative powers. There are also many 44 popular herbal remedies generally known to most persons. Castor oil, for example, is a simple physic procured from home-grown plants. The flower and top stem of opium poppies may be boiled and drunk when someone has diarrhea or dysentery. Some of the local practices seem much more novel. For instance, a fisherman says that for venereal disease he seeks out a live baby lizard about an inch and a half long and wraps it in the sticky underside of a soybean leaf. Folding over the ends of the leaf, he places this pastille on the back of his tongue, and swallows it without benefit of liquid. I contented myself with carefully checking on the fact that this treatment was not unique, but did not try it myself. But after all, perhaps a lizard accumulates penicillin from the soil. One way in which malaria is thought to be cured is by licking human excrement; another is to have the sufferer led around by a relative who shouts. ‘Buy malaria!’ The clinicians recommend quinine.

In the third quarter of the fifteenth century, a hospital was founded to care for those suffering from indigestion, a medical bureau was established, and Korean treatises on medicine were published. Previous to that time it would seem that the only authoritative medical works were the traditional Chinese texts, of which the first is attributed to the legendary Emperor Shen Nung in the third 268 millennium B. C. With the advent of the Yi dynasty, however, the accumulated experience of Korean practitioners began to be recognized although laymen still distinguished between the doctors who could read classical Chinese and those who could not.
Treatment consisted mainly of prescribing drugs, most of which were concocted from medicinal herbs and a touch of flavoring, but sometimes ingredients were added which strikes one as strange indeed from the standards of an empirical pharmacopoeia. Surgery was comprised almost wholly of acupuncture undertaken after the examination of the pulse. Then, following various theories and charts, the needle or other sharp instrument was inserted at some point of the body and withdrawn. Instead of this method, surgeons on occasion substituted an application of heat, either by employing a hot poultice or by burning one or more cones, usually made of the crushed stalk of mugwort (Artemesia), at certain places on the body. Needless to say, lacking anesthetics, this type of surgery, like any other, was not pleasant.

Treatment of disease and injury [colds, flu] may involve many distinct techniques. There are a great variety of professional medical practitioners such as Western-style doctors, traditional Chinese doctors, various folk specialties such as acupuncture, different shamans, and temple priests who furnish charms to drink. Most professionals are males but [Page 95] midwives are invariably females.
In addition to the professionals, there are local village amateurs. I cut my bare foot on a piece of bamboo in a rice paddy and it became badly infected. Two old villagers, an unrelated male and female, collected certain grasses in the mountain, chewed them thoroughly to make a soft wet lump which they applied to the cut as a poultice. The wound healed very quickly. Old age seems to be a prime characteristic of local medical specialists (non-professional) who are consulted regularly as experts.
Certain diseases and injuries are considered best treated by particular kinds of practitioners. There is considerable agreement on diagnosing and recommended treatment in the village. For example, a Chinese herb doctor is Hsin Tien is best for a broken bone and a Western doctor, for eye infections.
Self diagnosis and treatment is common. Although several older people in Talei Li are considered to have special medical abilities, most adults are amateur health practitioners. Itinerant salesmen leave bags containing [Page 96] a variety of different traditional and modern medicines hanging on the walls in houses. People use what they desire and when the salesman returns he replaces missing items and charges for them although there is no charge if none have been used. Different salesmen provide different combinations of drugs. There are 134 such medicine bags distributed among 59 of the 66 village households.

Tradition is important. Some people, particularly older ones, are considered to have such expertise with regard to cultural norms that acceptance of their authoritative interpretation of norms is frequent and natural. For example, a recently married woman wanted to go see her sister's new baby but knew there was some avoidance rule involving brides and babies. After learning from an older woman that a bride brought misfortune to a baby less than 30 days old, she willingly accepted the ruling and did not even seem disappointed. In many cases, there is this quite willing acceptance of custom for its own sake.
In summary, it appears that women are not significant on an overt level for social control in the contexts discussed in this chapter. They do not really participate in formal rule, politics, or most political units. Their effects are more covert. They influence men and are extremely significant in the socialization process which builds into individuals the internal mechanisms of social control.

As previously stated, it is hoped the first child will be a boy and boys will continue to be desired following the first child until the desired number is acquired. There are rituals to change the sex of the unborn child from female to male, some performed by the family and others by specialists, but villagers do not believe them very effective. It is also possible to detect the sex by various means such as computations involving the mother's age and month of conception.

At the onset of a cold or flu, a number of people now go either to a doctor or to a shot specialist in order to get a penicillin shot. It should be explained that there are people whose main job is to give injections of one or another drug; the village shot specialist in K'un Shen also gives shots to induce abortion. The village school provides smallpox vaccinations and treatment for trachoma. The use of doctors trained in modern medicine has also increased. There is an afternoon clinic, conducted by a doctor who commutes from Tainan for the half-day. It is now felt by many that certain illnesses are best cured by a doctor, if not in the village, then in a city hospital or clinic. These illnesses include tuberculosis, polio, malaria, cholera, meningitis (which is very commonly epidemic among young children), leprosy, flu (Asian and otherwise), diphtheria, serious animal bites, and asthma. Broken bones or sprains are not normally treated by a doctor; there are bonesetters in the city who specialize in this. For a time one of the village barberships had a dentist.

As indicated earlier in this chapter, magic requires a distinctive type of ritual in Hsin Hsing village supernaturalism. Perhaps the most important single use for magical ritual in the Hsin Hsing area is the curing of illness. As we noted above, the increased availability of Western medicine, especially since the early 1950's, the accessibility of practitioners trained in these ways, and the evidences of their success have turned the villagers more and more away from traditional practices, at least as the major and usually the initial source of help. Thus, the villager now tends to turn to the magical ritual only when he feels that modern science has failed him. However, it remains true that the traditional ritualistic patterns fulfill social, psychological, and even therapeutic functions beyond what is possible for the scientific.
There is no particular problem with illnesses which can be clearly diagnosed as natural or supernatural. But there are many cases in which the diagnosis is not so easy or clear-cut. Mainly, the villagers rely on past experience to tell them which set of symptoms indicates which category of illness, and thus which kind of practitioner to call in. Naturally, there are considerable variations among the villagers themselves which may predispose a decision in one direction or the other -- level of education, amount of experience, financial ability, and even types of social pressure. As one would expect, the actual availability of drugs and doctors affects choice. In recent years the dependence upon Western medicines and Western-oriented doctors has increased as a result of the increased supply of both at relatively low cost. The ease of access to antibiotics and patent medicines, their effectiveness, and the doctors' record of successes have given confidence in Western science, with the result that it is common today for the villagers to turn to Western methods first for most illnesses.
The attitude of the villagers toward the old and new medicine is a useful example of the way in which practical, external factors can affect “folk” beliefs and values. Here availability, finances, and family circumstances have combined to promote the acceptance of a new body of knowledge. The rural community of the Hsin Hsing area has accepted Western medicine without damage to its value structure or to its beliefs, incorporating the new quite comfortably into the old framework. Thus, when the villager calls upon a Western-style medical practitioner first of all, and the illness is not cured, he can still reinterpret the symptoms and assume that the cause was supernatural after all -- perhaps possession by a demon. Then, to cope with the supernatural, he calls in a shaman.

Although patron-client relationships are an extremely significant pattern in much of Taiwanese political life in high government circles and also in rural areas (Crissman 1969, Gallin 1968), they are not of great importance in Prosperity Settlement. People in the Settlement come, at times, to wealthy or knowledgeable neighbors for a loan or for help in accomplishing something outside the client's sphere of competence. The client may need information on good medical treatment, or help with transacting government-related business. Community leaders usually give aid where they can; to do otherwise would injure their reputations, but there are several wealthy families who are relatively uninvolved in such relationships.

Social and mental problems (except for psychosis) and non-medical problems are rarely taken to Western-style doctors if there are other practitioners available. Some are no doubt solved through discussions with friends and relatives; others are unresolved till death. Still others, which are best discussed under the classes of the “old-fashioned” taxonomy, are taken to religious and folk practitioners whose methods of description, diagnosis, and treatment are considered more appropriate to such problems....
The second class in native taxonomy -- “caused from your own body” -- may include almost any in the Western list of ailments (1-4). They will all be handled primarily with herbs, hû-á, and dietary prescriptions. They may be further explained by reference to hot, cold, and poison, to body processes. Occasionally Ong-ia-kong will also warn the person away from funerals. Other practitioners of sacred medicine who do not dispense herbs would refer an illness “from the body” to a doctor of Chinese or Western medicine....
According to the mothers I interviewed, the only one of these problems which is ever taken to a Western-style doctor is fright. I was told by Taipei doctors that the usual treatment is phenobarbital. The other supernatural grievances go exclusively to Chinese sacred medical practitioners, though the illnesses they cause are often treated with Western and Chinese secular medicine....
The villagers make use of the concepts of harmony and patching, along with numerous others from Chinese and Western medicine, to decide which medical system to start with when a person falls ill, and when and how to move between systems. The resultant pattern of multiple use relies heavily on self-diagnosis. Some diseases are considered appropriate for Western medicine (appendicitis, syphilis), some for Chinese secular medicine (rheumatism, broken bones), some for Chinese sacred medicine (fright, nightmares). However, most diseases can be seen as having aspects appropriate for treatment in more than one of the different systems. When a disease is seen by only one practitioner (of any type), it is most probably because it disappeared very rapidly rather than because the native taxonomic theory specified the system to which the complaint was appropriate....
The Western doctor in diagnosis uses a body of medical theory which is largely inaccessible to the patient. He rarely attempts to explain even the simplest parts of it: transmission of disease, purpose of test, side effects of medicine. He often does not even name the disease or the drugs or tell why he is doing what he does. The doctor plays no other role in the patient's life and pays no attention to the other aspects of the patient's life. Most doctors said they did not ask whether a woman was pregnant or ask about the home situation. Many problems having bearing on a patient's illness or state of mind are not considered relevant to Western medicine and are not brought up by either doctor or patient. Oral treatment is generally given on a daily basis so that the patient must return to get more medicine, instead of being instructed and then allowed to carry out his own treatment at home. The patient is questioned, manipulated, and injected as an object. In the end, the doctor's interaction with the patient often does not make the patient feel any better. He goes home not knowing what is wrong with him, what the doctor did or why, what the medicine he is taking is called and what it is likely to do to him. There is nothing he himself can do for his illness except finish taking the medicine and return to the doctor, or seek out a different practitioner. I don't know if this professional remoteness is modelled on traditional Chinese practice or is a product of Western training. However, it characterizes every Western doctor I met in Taiwan.

The Japanese established medical schools as early as 1902. They instituted licensing of local doctors and midwives and provided elementary instruction in western medicine to many Taiwanese practitioners. Although the training was apparently quite superficial, it was extensive enough to have a dramatic impact on the mortality rate.
During their stay in Taiwan, the Japanese made considerable efforts to discourage the practice of Chinese secular medicine. In 1897, just two years after their arrival, they held an examination for doctors of traditional Chinese medicine with ten years' experience. Every candidate passed the examination and received official permission to continue in practice, but after that time no further permits were issued. As a result, after two or three [Page 12] decades, with the deaths of the older members of the profession and the absence of new members, the number of officially sanctioned practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine declined rapidly and by 1945 had sunk to approximately thirty to forty on the whole island.
By 1925, the Japanese considered western medicine on Taiwan so advanced that it could take over the entire health care of the population. They launched a new and rather severe cultural program to further restrict the practice of any type of traditional secular medicine. This [Page 13] program was curtailed by Japan's involvement in World War II, since modern medicines and doctors were needed for the Japanese army. There was increased reliance in Taiwan on Chinese traditional practitioners; but there were severe limitations on the import of traditional drugs from the Mainland, and increased use of indigenous Taiwanese remedies in their place. This situation persisted until the Mainlanders took over in the forties. (Unschuld, 1976:4)

One practitioner we interviewed was a bone-setter. Since people believe that Chinese medicine is better for broken bones, he and his co-specialists have a virtual monopoly. There are, according to him, about twenty other bone-setters in Tapu; we saw only five. Our man has a very visible office on a main street, and is under contract to the railroad -- he is by far the busiest bone-setter in town. Most of his patients are working-class males, especially those engaged in housebuilding. He practices bone-setting and massage and dispenses herbs according to ancestral prescriptions. He said he was not allowed to prescribe herbs except in connection with broken bones, but it is thought that proper therapy of broken bones requires both internal and external application of herbs. The bone-setter is a member of the Association of Chinese Gymnastics, and runs a gymnasium in addition to his bone-setting establishment. Since he does not have a license to practice as a Chinese doctor, he refers serious cases to Taita Hospital so that no one will die under his care.

A person who has exhausted the Chinese secular resources of Tapu will consult neighbors about unusual herb cures or try out-of-the-way practitioners. For instance, in a very small town south of Tapu lived a family with an ancient and secret recipe for curing acute athlete's foot. A laborer who was actually disabled with athlete's foot had found this family after trying western doctors in Tapu and Taipei and Chinese doctors in Tapu.
Chinese secular medical resources do not form a hierarchy or really any regular structure at all. There is no organization which holds the practitioners of Chinese medicine together, no conferences to keep doctors up to date, no coordination with public health, no uniformity of training, and no association even to set fees. Though there does exist in Taiwan a strong political lobbying group for Chinese medicine, none of these doctors participates. It is mainly an organization of Mainlanders which carries on its activities in Taipei in circles which never touch these men.

But Chinese sacred medicine shares virtually nothing with the western-style medicine practiced in Taiwan. It is practiced in temples or in front of household altars with the smoke of incense, candles, and burning spirit money and the sound of chants, instrumental music, and firecrackers. The practitioners are often the old, blind, and lame. Their remuneration is considered a gift, not a payment. Their equipment makes no attempt to resemble the scientific and they have no official sanction or regulation. Training is through apprenticeship or revelation. The herbs prescribed are often those growing wild by the rivers or in the mountains. And the behavior of spirits is important in most diagnoses and treatments.
What I call the sacred medical tradition is an amalgamation of the concepts of China's great traditions of Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, combined with folk religion, translated into practice, and expressed symbolically with ritual and everyday objects. The folk tradition [Page 91] has generated its own specialists to minister to perceived medical needs which are not met elsewhere. In addition to the health problems that are familiar to western readers, Taiwanese suffer from several ailments which may be loosely classed as supernatural.

Our final practitioner of sacred medicine in Tapu is called Sien-si n Ma. Her patients are almost entirely infants and young children suffering from fright and, occasionally, T'u-sha. She is a woman in her late sixties [Page 108] or early seventies, who, with her husband and one daughter-in-law, runs a small general store at the foot of the mountain. In the room adjoining the store -- hardly a room, it is merely separated by shelves -- is an altar with an assortment of the usual gods (Kuan Yin, Matsu, Kuan Kung), incense pots, and the like. On the side is a small table holding the three types of powdered herbal medicine she uses, and the incense and spirit money for her rituals. Outside the shop is a cool, shaded veranda running along a large ditch. Many people pass by her store, and school children stop to buy sweets. A mother, often accompanied by her husband or mother-in-law, brings in a baby or young child. Usually the complaint is that the child has not been sleeping or eating well, or has fever, diarrhea, or a cold. Often the child has already been to a doctor, and the medicine has not worked as expected. Sometimes the child has exhibited strange crying, unaccompanied by the symptoms that would make it appropriate to see a doctor.
Sien-si n Ma takes the baby on her lap, unwraps it to look into its eyes, ears, and mouth, feels its chest and belly, and sometimes its spine or shoulder bones. She pours a little boiled water from a thermos into a rice bowl on the table next to her. Putting a wad of cotton into the water, she rubs the baby's gums with it. Then she dips her finger into one or two of her herb powders and rubs that on the baby's gums. She then rewraps the baby, [Page 109] hands it back to the mother, but keeps some blanket or piece of the baby's clothing that the mother has brought. The mother sits on the stool while Sien-si n Ma lights the altar candles and the incense and begins to chant.
In the chant she calls upon Kuan Yin, Matsu, Wu Nien, Ch'ien Sui, and Kuan Kung. She asks the gods to send the soul back to the baby. She tells the parents' name and address, and the age and sibling order of the baby. She lights some spirit money at the altar, and then, facing the doorway, burns some on the floor. While it burns, she continues to chant and swings the patient's clothes over the burning money. She tells the mother to call the patient's name and tell it to come back. The mother calls three or more times. Then Sien-si n Ma throws the divination blocks to determine whether the soul has returned as requested. If she gets a negative answer, the mother continues calling, and Sien-si n Ma continues chanting. She tries the blocks again until she gets a positive answer. When that occurs, she takes a pinch of the ashes and puts it on the clothing, another pinch for the baby's forehead. She returns to the altar, chants a bit more, and splashes some water on the clothes. She burns one more pile of spirit money near the altar and instructs the mother, carrying the baby and holding some of the incense sticks, to step over the spirit-money fire. Then Sien-si n Ma returns the baby's clothes to the mother, who wraps them around the baby. Sien-si n Ma is now finished, [Page 110] and usually goes to sit down. The mother puts some small amount of money somewhere on the table and takes her baby home.

Fortune-tellers inform the parents of the gates or barriers the child must cross. Sometimes this is related to the prohibitions mentioned above. For example, it is sometimes said that if the child must cross the King of Hell gate he cannot go to his mother's natal home. More common are references to the fire, vehicle, and water gates, discussed in Chapter III. If the child must cross such a gate, then he is in danger from that source: he may be burned, hit by a train or taxi, or drowned. A particularly serious case of measles was explained as due to the fact that the child had to cross the “measles gate”. Taoists, spirit mediums, and other ritual specialists at temples and altars are often busy getting supplicants through or across such gates.
Apparently faith in these procedures is not very strong. Although some people thought it was good to have these ceremonies performed, others, like Chia Sio-chin, thought it was better not to take the child's fortune at all because it would just make you worry about this or that barrier. There must be considerable doubt that crossing barriers with a Taoist really assures the child any safeth, if the mother would willingly choose to risk the child's life rather than have the ceremony performed. Sim So-chu expressed distress that, although they had had the child's fortune told at birth, when she took the baby to a Taoist for spiritual treatment of a later problem, the [Page 158] practitioner said there were barriers for the child which the original fortune-teller hadn't mentioned. The mothers didn't know which person to believe.

We have seen that the Tapu area includes many different practitioners, each offering a particular kind of care, each with its own style and its own specialties. Each of these practitioners is quite busy treating clients. But care offered by the Wang Yeh Kung tang-ki seemed to me the most comprehensive, the most able to treat the whole person and the most coordinated with the other medical possibilities....
As mentioned above, most people do not go exclusively to one medical practitioner or even restrict themselves to one medical system. Any illness which is not cured quickly at home, or does not respond to primary care, or occurs in conjunction with other problems, or appears in any way strange or complex, may prompt the patient or his family to seek secondary care. This leads to a complex interweaving of the separate strands we have discussed in this chapter; this interweaving is the subject of the next chapter.
Against this general pattern of infrequent referrals within the sacred medical system, Wang Yeh Kung is an exception. He refers more frequently than most other sacred practitioners, and his referrals are regarded in a highly positive light. For one thing, he always supplies some treatment himself, even when he refers. That is, he treats certain aspects of the problem (and that treatment is regarded as necessary) but explains that other aspects must be treated elsewhere. He does not withdraw himself from the patient's problem by sending the patient away; rather, he recommends additional treatment by another practitioner. Thus a pregnant woman concerned about the T'ai-shen will be given a fu for protection during pregnancy and be advised to deliver the baby at a large western hospital. (Obviously Wang Yen Kung does not deliver babies.) Most people who go to Wang Yeh Kung are also thinking of seeing western doctors. By referral, he directs them to a particular specialty (e.g., gynecologist, proctologist), a specific doctor, or to one of the several choices they were contemplating (e.g., hospital delivery vs. midwife delivery).
Wang Yeh Kung can perform almost all the rituals of the small specialists and of the large temples, except of course the annual and monthly celebrations. He can [Page 222] answer questions far more satisfactorily than is possible with the divining blocks found in temples. And, most importantly, he is the only local sacred practitioner with knowledge of Chinese herb medicine. Unfortunately, one probably cannot generalize from this tang-ki to others -- I heard of no others who regularly prescribed such a wide range of medicines....
The search for efficacy of cure is unlike doctor-hopping as it involves more conscious evaluation of practitioners and definite decisions for or against certain ones. It resembles movement to Taipei as, in both secular branches of medicine, Taipei is thought of as the [Page 224] place with the more efficacious practitioners, facilities, and cures. But efficacy ( ling ) is applied specifically to sacred religious medicine and therefore the search does not move to Taipei in particular but may take the patient almost anywhere in the island. A god who does not produce results is not ling; one who does is ling (even a god with humble or recent origins and a rustic or unadorned setting) and will soon have a loyal and growing clientele, as Wang Yeh Kung does....
Furthermore, there are prohibitions and recommendations [relating to food and diet]. Some, like Wang Yeh Kung's persistent campaign against bananas, I regret.

When I knew her, A-bi was 16 years old, a normal Taiwanese adolescent except that she walked with a slight limp and did much more work than the average teenage girl. She had to, because she lived alone with her blind grandfather in the poorest housing in Ploughshare -- two dirt-floored rooms of an old mud-brick compound across the street from our house. A-bi's grandfather Tiu: Pun-a, made a little money as a medical practitioner -- he was reputed to be adept at setting bones and at curing injuries caused by falls, but living in an out-of-the-way place like Ploughshare he didn't have much business. So it seemed a good thing all around when A-bi went to work in an electronics factory near the market town of Shu-lin -- she worked the 4 p.m. to midnight shift, and the bus from the factory transported her both ways. But Pun-a's satisfaction turned to grave apprehension on February 21, when A-bi did not return on the midnight bus.

In Ploughshare, villagers have ties with practically all other villagers, and the network of dyadic links is much thicker within the village than outside of it. For major things, it is best to rely on kin, affines, or sworn kin. But for little everyday matters, people cooperate with anyone toward whom they have no active animosity. For example, I remember a village woman whose husband was ill, and who was told by a folk practitioner that he ought to eat the meat of a tho-ke , a chicken that had been allowed to forage and not been given any commercial chicken feed. She simply asked around the village until she found one.

Unfortunately, no study of differences in the use of different kinds of doctors is yet available. I can only offer evidence of another kind from a question asked of the same people represented in Table 1. They were asked what kind of professional help they thought they would seek for a variety of different kinds of ailments, from a skin rash to severe stomach pain. Despite the variation in attitudes disclosed in Table 1, practically the entire sample indicated they would make greater use of Western-style practitioners. Of course, this fact cannot be taken as evidence that most everyone actually makes more use of Western-style doctors; it is only an indication that the use of Western-style doctors is not insignificant even among those whose attitudes as described in Table 1 incline them toward Chinese-style medicine.
In this part of Taiwan, for the moment at least, a population of laymen with certain ideas about what disease is, confront one set of experts (Chinese-style doctors) with roughly similar ideas and another set of experts (Western-style doctors) with substantially different ideas.

One element in the villagers' attempt to find cures for illness is their concern about finding the cause of the illness. Anecdotal evidence of this is plentiful. One man who had been to several practitioners in an unsuccessful attempt to find relief from severe stomach pain exclaimed to me, “I can't stand it. Unless I can find out what the cause of this illness is, I don't know what cure to use. I'm completely at a loss.” In an effort to find out whether the importance this man gave to knowing [Page 100] the cause of an illness was widespread, I asked several questions to this point on a questionnaire administered informally to about 40 villagers. In one question 46 informants were asked to indicate which of eight factors they felt was most important in choosing a doctor. Sixteen (35 percent) chose the answer, “He explains the cause of an illness clearly.” No other single answer came close to this percentage. Another question was phrased as follows: “Suppose there are two doctors in the same town. It is equally convenient for you to go to either of them. One explains to you the cause of your sickness whereas the other just gives medicine with no explanation. Would you think it important to visit the one who gives explanations?” Forty of the 43 (93 percent of those responding to this question) gave a positive answer. Thirty-two of these 40 (80 percent) gave an emphatic answer such as, “It's very important to visit the doctor who gives explanations.” These answers indicate that many people regard finding out the cause of an illness as an important part of the process of seeing a doctor....
Which kind of practitioner one seeks out depends on which kind of illness one suspects is involved. In general, illnesses caused from within the body are believed to be best treated by Western or Chinese-style doctors. ... They treat by administering medicine -- antibiotics, vitamins, etc. -- in the form of orally-taken powders or injections. Chinese-style doctors, also available to the Ch'inan villagers, diagnose with the help of feeling the pulse or studying the color of the complexion. They treat by administering herbs or other natural substances and by warning the patient away from certain foods, measures often designed to correct an imbalance of hot and cold. Although their methods are very different, both kinds of doctors are seen as being able to cure disease that arises from within the body....
This notion that an illness with one set of symptoms can have different causes at different times means that people always have in mind the possibility that the first practitioner they choose to heal an illness may not be the correct one. If the cure he administers fails to get results, they will be likely to switch to another practitioner of the same type or to a practitioner of a different type entirely. The important premise [Page 102] seems to be that there are specific cures attached to specific causes.

From a functional point of view, various types of care do not have any interrelations. Modern psychiatrists are concerned with the mental health situation of the whole society, and they usually make an effort to maintain close relations with modern medical workers and modern counsellors. However, there is no extension of contact to the folk care system. Among folk practitioners every person performs individually and there is no organization within this system. The general attitude is one of ignorance of each other, almost of suspicion, and cooperation between practitioners is not attempted.

A mother-in-law with no grandchildren will not be able to restrain herself for long. Some action is called for, and it usually involves a visit to the tang ki . A tang ki is a religious practitioner who serves as an intermediary for a god. The god takes possession of the tang ki' s body and speaks through him to the suppliants. People come to the tang ki to ask his god for help in finding lost items, curing sick people and animals, changing a family's economic fortune, settling quarrels with relatives or friends, and solving the problem of infertility in [Page 150] pigs and brides. Usually the cause of a misfortune is discovered to be a ghost or a supernatural troublemaker from popular mythology who must be placated with offerings, but the tang ki 's prescription is often more commonsensical than his diagnosis. We have heard more than once of a tang ki who advised a client to consult a medical doctor, and on one sad occasion we listened to a tang ki advise an old lady to go home and prepare mourning clothes. He had “saved” her aged husband once before, but the old man had now lived far beyond his allotted years.

With the decline of shamanism, most Yakut rely on Western medicine administered in hospitals and clinics. Yet rumors persist of faith healing, described as spiritual or hypnotic. A few Yakut with shamanic family backgrounds attend medical school, supporting beliefs that healing talent can be inherited. Traditional healers (who had long periods of apprenticeship) were specialized, with herbal experts, bonesetters, shaman's assistants, and various grades of shamanic power. Sources vary as to whether male or female shamans were more powerful. Drumming and the music of the of the KHOMUS enhanced a shaman's trance during séances to ascertain the cause of illness. Each person was believed to have three souls, which were necessary to maintain health.

There are many individuals famed in some degree as physicians. Some are equivalent to the general practitioners of the West, while others are specialists who possess remedies for particular diseases. There are others who might be described as veterinary physicians. When, however, an illness persists the patient and the relatives suspect that some supernatural agency is at work, and they then call in the ojha, or magician. The ojha is not necessarily a Santal, though there are now so many Santals who are learned in ojha art that it is usually possible for a Santal to be called. They are men possessed of special powers who have gone through a period of training, followed by an initiation ceremony at the hands of an ojha, and they in turn pass on their knowledge to their own disciples. Tradition says that formerly this training was strenuous and serious. It took the form of a course that lasted from May until October, the time of the Dãsã[unavailable], which is the same as the Dasserah festival of North India and the Durga Puja in Bengal. Throughout this period the disciples had to attend at the house of the ojha every evening until finally they were initiated. At the conclusion of this ceremony the ojha used to take his disciples on a begging expedition through the surrounding villages on three successive days.

At present there is no hamaduruwo , ‘Buddhist monk’, resident in Rangama and, therefore, no one to officiate over certain of the ceremonies. During my 1965 stay, there were organized efforts to bring a monk to Rangama permanently, but by 1968 there was still no one willing to reside there. The villagers, particularly the upaas[unknown]k[unknown]s , continually lament the absence of clergy and put down their failure to attract a monk to the difficulty of access and the relatively poor diet, factors which should not enter into consideration but apparently do, nevertheless. There have been several Rangama residents who have entered the order, and most of them still belong to it but reside elsewhere. One village elder has derobed and resides in Rangama, however. At one time he was in charge of the Rangama temple. At present, he serves as an ayurvedic or native physician and maintains a [Page 745] polyandrous household with his younger brother. Villagers cite the brother’s wife as the cause for indecision concerning the order. The former monk is said to have entered and left the order several times. When I first arrived in Rangama I was told that the Rangama monk had ‘died’, a common way of referring to derobed monks in Ceylon. In the Rangama case, there is additional embarrassment stemming from the ex-monk’s reasons for leaving the order. I am unable to comment first hand on the reception of ex-monks elsewhere in Ceylon, but in Rangama there has been apparently no attempt to ostracize this man. For example, he was not the focus of ‘evil eye’ accusations, a common method of effecting attenuated relations, nor of accusations of sorcery, a method of severing them (MacDougall, ms.). The only index of possible past tensions is the location of the polyandrous household; the dwelling is one of the furthest afield in the village. Villagers, however, connect the location of the dwelling with efforts to distract official attention from the marriage. The ex-monk also maintains a room in the village nucleus, perhaps for this purpose. One suspects, however, that the distant location was judiciously chosen to minimize any possible conflict with others over the polyandrous union and the rejection of the sangha . One significant reason why he enjoys good relations with the rest of the villagers is that his considerable expertise is valued and even necessary. He is the most important [Page 746] and most knowledgeable ayurvedic physician. He is also familiar with the textual material on such matters as housebuilding. Furthermore, in the absence of an ordained monk, he is next best. He knows the religious rituals and often leads the chanting of pirit , ‘the scriptures’, at the temple on full moon days. On occasion, he says ban[unknown] , ‘sermons’, which are normally delivered only by ordained monks, but I never witnessed such a preaching.
A monk might normally officiate at the temple on full moon days, at funerals and at such rituals as the consecration of a house. Efforts to bring monks to the village for such occasions sometimes succeed. When one arrives, attempts are often made to organize a ban[unknown] preaching as well.

Specialists in Rangama concerned with protective or curative technologies may be subdivided into two broad categories which are related to depth and breadth of expertise: specialists who use titles derived from their specialty (major specialists) and specialists who do not use titles (minor specialists). The major specialists resident in Rangama include an astrologer, two kapuraalas , two ayurvedic physicians and a waDuraala , ‘master builder’. These individuals are assumed to have broad knowledge of the principles of an entire specialty. Minor specialists are technicians whose knowledge is considered more limited. In the case of ayurvedic medicine, for example, they are not considered specialists on the entire science and do not diagnose sarvange leD[unknown] , ‘systemic diseases’. Minor specialists in astrology do not cast horoscopes and are thought to lack the requisite knowledge. They confine themselves to tasks of a less comprehensive nature such as calculating auspicious times for beginning important activities. As for the minor specialists associated with yakk[unknown]m[unknown] , ‘demonology’, there are a couple of apprentices to the kapuraalas and a number of individuals whose expertise is limited to such matters as removing spells. Minor specialists who [Page 810] could be grouped with the waDuraala are only carpenters. Since they are not specialists in a protective or curative technology, they are not classed here with the other major and minor specialists cited above.
Any specialist, major or minor, engaged in diagnosing conditions and prescribing countermeasures is considered to practice a kaar[unknown]n[unknown] , lit., ‘cause’. Only major specialists whose work is referable to the ancient learned traditions are considered to know saastra s or vidyaaw[unknown] s, ‘sciences’. These latter two terms are Sanskrit borrowings and are recognized as learned words. They suggest ‘theory’ embracing an entire specialty. kaar[unknown]n[unknown] is not considered a learned word and suggests ‘practice’ or ‘practical art’. All the major specialists in Rangama are considered to be experts on an ancient learned tradition with the exception of the kapuraala s who are not associated with one. Unlike the other major specialists, the talents of a kapuraala lie not in knowing but in mediating. The analogy in function between the kapuraala who mediates between human beings and supernaturals and the magul kapuraala , ‘marriage broker’, who mediates between human beings exclusively has already been pointed out elsewhere (Yalman 1967:161).
Although the prospective owner of the dwelling frequently supplies most of the labor in Rangama, dwelling construction is frequently planned and supervised by the waDuraala who has learned both construction techniques and rituals associated with construction in an apprenticeship to another master builder. Furthermore, any piece [Page 811] of construction or portion thereof which requires knowledge of special construction techniques is also executed by this man. In wattle and daub dwellings, for example, the construction of doors, door frames, windows and window frames requires specialized knowledge. The waDuraala claims to have executed this woodworking for approximately twenty Rangama dwellings. Other specialized knowledge includes stone work, cement work and brick work.

Some prescriptions about auspicious measurements for the dwelling are given in the appended Mayimataya , verses 43-46. Much more elaborate information is contained in the Vaastu Vidyaawa and in the Ge Biim Saastra which detail appropriate measurements for dwellings of individuals belonging to various castes and holding various offices within a feudal hierarchy. Astrological specialists concerned with dwelling construction are well-informed on these elaborate prescriptions, and a few individuals claim to have built their houses according to them. The ‘castes’ referred to, at least in the Ge Biim Saastra , are not Sinhalese castes (as is the case in many portions of the Mayimataya ) but the Indian varnas , and the feudal offices referred to do not have any contemporary relevance for the Sinhalese. Residents who have used these prescriptions claim to have done so in the following fashion: they follow the prescriptions given for the Vaisaya varna which traditionally included cultivators. Since most Rangama residents are cultivators by caste and occupation, such prescriptions are considered the appropriate ones.
Information on auspicious measurements can be obtained from astrological specialists, not from the waDuraala . The only restriction which the waDuraala places on the dimensions of the dwelling is that he will not take even measurements for the length and breadth of the dwelling. He considers odd numbers auspicious.

The traditional spheres of influences of both ayurvedic physicians and dwelling construction specialists in the little community are receiving re-definition in modern Ceylon, and standards with which the traditional specialist frequently cannot comply are being set. In Ceylon, modern medicine whether it is indigenous or Western, has been institutionalized so that there are schools, certificates and centers for the practice of medicine. The village ayurvedic physician who is not associated with the institutions of modern medicine emerges in the hierarchy as a second rung specialist. It is not simply the fact that he is associated with a traditional ‘science’ and not Western medicine that calls his authority into question. There is general confidence in ayurvedic medicine, and the Ceylon government gives official encouragement to its practice. It is rather that the village specialist either is a successful apprentice to another local practitioner, perhaps to an older, more experienced close relative, or is in some cases even self-taught. His ‘science’, on the other hand, has become institutionalized along the lines of Western medicine and has adopted some of its practices.

The traditional spheres of influences of both ayurvedic physicians and dwelling construction specialists in the little community are receiving re-definition in modern Ceylon, and standards with which the traditional specialist frequently cannot comply are being set.... In a similar fashion the dwelling construction specialist in the little community finds his expertise challenged by a new type of specialist who is deemed better qualified in the wider community. In recent times [Page 916] a distinction has been made between ordinary carpenters and licensed construction specialists, and only the latter are permitted to obtain contracts for the construction of government buildings. Neither the Rangama waDuraala nor any of the other carpenters resident in the village possess a license, for they are unfamiliar with many of the modern construction techniques necessary to obtain one. They have not been apprenticed to other licensed practitioners. Not unexpectedly, the ritual activities which are fundamental in the definition of traditional ‘design’ are irrelevant in obtaining a license.

Childbirth: When a baby is being born, material and spiritual preparations will be made ready. About ninety-nine percent of the people in the village still have their delivery at home through traditional devices. The delivering doctor of the village is called mo tamyae. Mo refers to a doctor or a practitioner of a professional skill. Tamyae is, according to tradition, the name of the rishi or wise man who was the originator of the art of delivery. It is found that the mo tamyae is almost always a woman.
When the mother is struck with pain, the mo tamyae will be called in to do the necessary job. Members of the family also have to help with other arrangements.
The mother sits up and delivers her baby in a sitting position. At this extremely painful moment, the mother holds on to a piece of robe hanging from the ceiling. The mo tamyae supports her back and tries to ease her pain. If the delivery is difficult, the mo tamyae may help by pressing the mother's womb. Sometimes holy water is given to her to drink.

Similarly the monk's role as healer and apothecary especially, in urban areas, has to some extent been usurped by the more widespread acceptance of the methods of witthayasat (science) whose practitioners, the doctors and nurses of Ayutthaya, are more accessible to the townsfolk. The bhikkhu's function as banker and money-lender has also been taken over by professionals, whilst it is in the very nature of the greater occupational diversity and specialization of the urban situation that few monks are qualified to give advice on occupational problems.

In M[unavailable]nbur[unavailable] were also a few “second class practitioners.” These were not graduates of Thailand's recognized medical schools, but they had some modern medical knowledge. A former medical orderly in the army, for instance, utilized his training to set up a practice. These practitioners used both traditional and modern systems. They would on rare occasions come to a Bang Chan farm house on call. They enjoyed the confidence and patronage of the most educated, progressive, and affluent element in Bang Chan's population, such as the teachers and many of the leaders, both young and old, who, in their patronage, saw themselves as less old-fashioned. Their large practice was lucrative, fees of 1000 baht for a course of injections being cited. Though consulted for maladies of pregnancy, to our knowledge they did no obstetrical work.

Though the poor felt the 20 to 30 baht cost of a midwife was too expensive, and so utilized the free help of a compassionate kinsman (usually the mother) or neighbor, the latter sometimes were as expert manually as a midwife or even on their way to becoming one.

The persons authorized to handle any part of saiyas[unavailable]t were called [unknown]. In the context of medicine, [unknown] was translated “doctor.” To keep the modern and ancient traditions separate, we shall use the Thai word “ [unknown]” throughout this paper for the practitioner of the ancient occult art, reserving the word “doctor” for physicians trained in modern medicine.
The field of medicine was split into categories or specialties. There were, for instance, the exorcisers of spirits or disease objects ( [unknown] ph[unavailable]), and the curers ( [unknown] raks[unavailable]) who made up decoctions particularly for element imbalances. Astrologist-foretellers ( [unknown] d[unavailable]) analysed disturbances due to astral confluences; soul-ceremonialists ( [unknown] khwan) carried on the khwan-strengthening rites; and the [unknown] san[unavailable] specialized in love and hate magic. On a lower plane were masseurs ( [unknown] n[unavailable]at) and mid-wives ( [unknown] tamy[unavailable][unavailable]). No specialist could operate in the field of another unless he had formally acquired that specialty. No limits, though, were set on the number of specialties a person might acquire so that all their lives, [unknown] were open to and seeking new knowledge by pilgrimage, discussion, or visit to a Chinese or modern druggist. The major curing specialties were only in the hands of males, but men and women both practiced the minor branches of midwifery and massaging. 
An ill individual made a preliminary self-diagnosis to ascertain which was the pertinent specialist to consult. A quick cure occurred if the diagnosis were correct, because the specialist then had the exact curing agent and magic for that disorder. If the first [unknown] were unsuccessful, the patient moved on without embarrassment to another. In fact, a person might be a-ouring with 2 or 3 [unknown] at once, and a modern doctor besides (cf. Hauck, 1956:37):
“She goes to [unknown] Suk who is good for spirits, and to [unknown] Plung at Lam Pakachet who is good for headaches and vomiting. Two years ago her child was sick with san chak and was cured by [unknown] Suk. First she took the child to Suk but a few days later went to Sawad at Lolae because she was afraid the child would die. Sawad gave tablets. She did not revisit either [unknown] because the child recovered. [unknown] Suk helped most because he had experience in magic” (SS.).
For reasons of convenience, however, people also developed lasting relationships with particular [unknown], usually the nearest, or a kinsman, to whom they turned first for medical help.

About the seventh month, D[unavailable]an pondered who should help her at her delivery. Some of her friends were delivered by their own mothers, but Lek had undertaken the delivery of another daughter's child, and the baby had died in an hour. D[unavailable]an suspected that her mother, therefore, would prefer not to do it, and knew that she herself would feel uneasy. So she decided for safety's sake to ask a midwife. She and Song could well afford the ceremonial offering with its customary 20 or so baht, even though the midwife said it was “as you please.” A great many women never consulted with a midwife beforehand at all, but just sent word to the nearest one when the pains started or when trouble was encountered. Midwives varied in their capabilities, however, and D[unavailable]an wanted not only a good one but someone she knew well. Muslim midwives were said to be skilled, but they happened to live too far from her. D[unavailable]an decided to ask her elder aunt, S[unavailable][unavailable], who was a well known midwife. Everything was right about S[unavailable][unavailable] She had experienced hands, a true desire to help, and effective magic; and she was a relative. Best of all, her own babies had eaten and slept well, had cried little, and now were grown to maturity. With such proof of merit, capabilities, and fortunate relations with supernatural powers, what better person to help D[unavailable]an start her baby on its earthly existence? Actually, if something happened, and S[unavailable][unavailable] could not come, D[unavailable]an knew she would not be alone or unassisted. Almost every woman, and quite a few men, had [Page 43] seen childbirth not once, but many times, so willing hands abounded. So, one day, D[unavailable]an went to S[unavailable][unavailable]. “Will you help me, and come when I call you? Please do not go far at that time.” S[unavailable][unavailable] agreed, knowing in her heart she had expected to care for D[unavailable]an. No day could be calculated because the baby decided when to be born. D[unavailable]an came home very fast, for doing so would help ensure a fast delivery.

If difficulties developed, then a more experienced person, preferably a midwife, was needed. But many a midwife assisted at normal births. Because difficulties might arise from a deficiency of merit either in the mother or the child (one could never know which), many women preferred to have in attendance, for peace of mind, either a midwife or an experienced person to insure the presence of expert help. Sometimes they were engaged in advance, more often just sent for “as pain is increasing,” it being not always certain whether the case was normal or not....
In their social role, midwives felt personal but not group solidarity. A solid bond existed between an older midwife and the particular younger one to whom he or she had given training and magic. Those related by blood or marriage sometimes worked together, and even turned over cases to each other if outside demands became pre-eminent. If in trouble on a case, midwives did not call on each other unless as close, affectionate relatives but turned rather for help from a [unknown] or to the Mïnbur[unavailable] Health Center. Yet sometimes rivalry was severe. If the family of the parturient felt that no progress was being made with one midwife, they called in another and another. Each did his utmost and then stepped down when it had to be admitted, “My magic is not enough.” The final expert who brought mother and baby through before the deposed midwives glowed inwardly with pride and skill and satisfaction that the magic of his particular teacher had proved effective. The sharpness of the competition reverberated through the words, “I pushed the other midwives down.” Community standing or “face” was not lost by an unsuccessful case because of the midwives' fundamental role as helpers only, their faith in their own experiences, and again, the conviction that the course of childbirth was merit-determined.
Midwives were called [unknown] tamy[unavailable][unavailable] (doctor-expert-in-occultism; pounding, as in a mortar [McF. 365] crouching, [McF. 682]). There were 4 or 6 women, both Buddhist and Muslim, and 2 or 3 Buddhist men, who had delivered 100 or so babies apiece. They ranged in age from 50 to 70. Dozens of women had delivered babies one or more times but were not accorded the title of midwife.
The foundation of their specialty was a greater than usual manual skill, developed over long experience. “We have only our hands,” said one woman. The more expert could handle certain mal-positions, and did not hesitate, but only with permission, to put the hand into the vagina to turn the baby or “unstop the blood.” They were better judges of the progress of labor, whether normal or slow, and of the symptoms of debility. They were more likely to keep calm in the face of extreme suffering where the parturient's relatives, over-eager in their desire to help, sometimes inflicted [Page 87] severe injury, such as bruising by excessive pressing, or even in hysteria pulling the child to pieces in their effort to get it out. 66
66. To give something of the measure of their skill: if the feet of the baby appeared first, one man “straightened the legs by hand inside, held the chin carefully as the head came through,” while another said, “Do not press or reach into the vagina. Let the baby come naturally.” If an arm came first, or it were a breech presentation (“the baby is turned over”), the procedure was to “pull and press lightly,” but it was conceded that neither the mother nor child could be saved. Expulsion of the placenta was frequently difficult. “It may take 2 hours or stay in 2 days or more. Some die when it is left in, but some do not.” The technique of removal was to give a medicine, press, pull with the hands rubbed with alum for a better grip, with the woman in a crawling position. Some reached into the vagina to locate it. One woman had analyzed her practice so as to know when to expect trouble: namely, in the later pregnancies and childbirths, i.e. the sixth and seventh, say, rather than in the early ones during a woman's younger years.
As to mortality, one “professional” man estimated 30 deaths of babies out of 238 deliveries in 50 years. Hauck (1956) reported 90.6% live births (pp. 32–33), 7% of the babies dying in the first month, 11% within the first year (pp. 39–41). One should remember that the professionals had a greater proportion of difficult cases. One woman had delivered over 100 babies and “all lived.”
The male midwives, then, were in a somewhat different category than the females. They were [unknown] who had, in addition, trained their hands for midwifery as an “extra specialty.” Midwifery seems to have been one of the few areas where skilled hands were considered of greater importance than magic. “We have no magic for delivery,” said one male midwife, knowing that nothing but merit could guarantee success. Because they had access to the incantations for element and spirit control, and could make holy water, the midwife-[unknown] could spare the parturient the necessity of getting in an outside [unknown], if such were needed. However, one part of the midwife's job the men could not do. To protect their male powers of invulnerability they were forbidden to wash the woman's clothing. A woman or a female midwife always had to do this. Men also could not provide the female “mystique” particularly related to the khwan and to growth.
The professional midwives, both men and women, saw themselves as individual custodians of sacred knowledge and competent in a technique. They were not only interested and ready, but obligated to give expert care to anyone, anywhere it was needed.
Since these 2 worlds were qualitatively different, each required a different method of learning. The supernatural world, immaterial, royal and sacred, was learned [Page 93] by instruction from a ritually 71 approached teacher. “One cannot accidentally learn. One has to ask to be taught.” As a practitioner in this field, the title “[unknown]” signalized expertise; where teaching was involved, the title was khr[unavailable] (teacher [McF. 183]) or [unavailable][unavailable]h[unavailable]n (professor [McF. 990]). Speech was the key to this tradition, in spite of sacred books and wall-carvings in the temples.

Within the community of Bang Chan, about 8 traditional “doctors” and 15 traditional midwives practiced their skills. Three of the traditional practitioners were Buddhist persists. The others earned their living chiefly by farming. In addition, two or three persons who were skilled at massage, and at least one medium had some reputation for success in treating sick persons....
Illness was reported as occurring in 4 households only. In one of these, a 49-year old man reported loss of sensation over the extremities and other symptoms which led the physician in the research group to conclude that he had beriberi. As treatment, this man had used an herb recommended by a priest, a native medicine given him by a neighbor and had gone to a private clinic at Minburi where he received an injection. 1 In another family, a 39-year old man who had asthma, took an advertised remedy which he purchased from a drugstore. Two children in the third family had fever for 8 days, for which a traditional practitioner prescribed herbs. In the fourth family, a 1-year old child with eczema was taken first to a traditional practitioner, then to a private clinic in Minburi where he was given an injection....
Fifteen of the 24 persons who were seriously ill had treatment by modern doctors, several patients receiving treatment from more than one. Thirteen patients had one type of treatment only (as that from either traditional practitioner or modern doctor), 7 used 2 types, 3 used 3 types, and 1 had 4 types of treatment from 5 individuals. The latter case was that of a child who was described as sick for 60 days with pneumonia, neck swelling and fever, and was treated by a traditional practitioner, two persists who were also traditional practitioners, and a medium, all in Bang Chan, and a second-class doctor in Minburi. Another child who was sick with lom sandan (faintness, weakness or loss of consciousness) for three days was treated by 4 local traditional practitioners and a second-class doctor at Minburi. One child with saang (a disease of young children, said to be caused by the loss of the soul or spirit) was treated by the modern doctor at Minburi, only....
As a rule, local practitioners of one sort or another were visited or called first, those in Minburi next, and those in Bangkok, only after nearby help had been consulted. This order was not invariable however. For example, in the Hamlet KY-7 serios (Hanks, 1954) was one woman who was sick with beriberi for about 8 months after childbirth. She went first to a second-class doctor in Minburi, then to a nearby Muslim measure, then to a local traditional practitioner who gave her some jaa tom (cooked medicine). Another instance, recorded in the field notes, is that of a school teacher's baby who had abscesses on her head. The mother took her child first to Minburi, where she was given an injection and a sulfa drug to be taken orally. The child did not get well immediately, and before all of the drug had been taken, the mother took the child to a local traditional practitioner who gave her a decoction of herbs which was to be given by mouth. Thus in some cases, modern doctors were consulted first, and local traditional practitioners later, if relief was hot as speedy as was expected. The experience in this one hamlet suggested a willingness to try a variety of treatments, and the existence of a considerable degree of confidence in modern medicine....
A number of references were made to history of cholera, smallpox and malaria, but these did not appear to be current threats. Two cases of severe diarrhea were called “cholera” but one was on the way to recovery the next day. The traditional practitioner who was asked to treat the other, urged that she be taken to the hospital, and himself accompanied the patient and family members.

Secondly, in response to fateful forewarnings, villagers seek various types of protection by magic e.g., amulets such as a Buddha head sacralized by a priest or lay magician, ritual immunity to certain diseases or mishaps, protection by guardian spirits, or protection from malevolent spirits by propitiation in spirit houses (saan praphuum). The spheres of magic and divination may actually be combined in a single practitioner. Textor has described a female shaman possessed by a male spirit, at work in a central Thai village: “… offering advice, giving or promising help, pronouncing a sacralizing phrase over a containerful of medical ingredients, making predictions…. (Textor 1962: 56)”...
One particular sort of magical behavior, common in urban as in rural Thailand, is that of beginning important or potentially dangerous undertakings at an auspicious time divined by an astrologer. People who may be very casual about time in other contexts can become very meticulous about beginning some ritual or new effort precisely at the auspicious moment. This strong emphasis seems consistent with the value placed on initiating an action properly so that it will be a favorable precedent. As Hanks has observed:
… the first occurrence of any phenomenon establishes a precedent which defines all subsequent occurrences of this phenomenon. This … may be compared to Newton's law of motion, ‘a body in motion continues to move …’ extended to apply to psychic and moral as well as physical events … Precedents are also set by astral confluence … parents observed, ‘Since our son was born on Saturday, he will have a lot of power … nothing will harm him.’ (Hanks 1959: 7)....
Similarly, a traditional midwife explained to Hanks that she turned an expectant mother's feet away from the family spirit house and in line with, rather than against, the scales of the cosmic serpent's back (Hanks 1963: 45). Such esoteric knowledge requires informed specialists, since the cosmic serpent, for [Page 214] example, to whose direction human activity should conform, revolves completely every 24 hours (Textor 1960: 378, 423, quoted by Hanks 1963: 45).

Other methods of curing include the use of herbal medicines prepared by ritual specialists plus various techniques such as spitting sacred water over a painful part of the body and then stroking the area to draw out the pain. One farmer who had learnt a variety of magical herbal medicines from his father (which is the usual way in which this knowledge is transmitted) would also cover the sole of his foot with sacred oil, stand on a red hot plough-share, and then walk over the afflicted part of the patient, usually the legs. All these specialists who are referred to as [unknown] doctor, are men. The only women [unknown] are midwives ( [unknown] tham y[unavailable]e), but there are none resident in Hua Kok.
Men practising curing techniques are said to have wich[unavailable], knowledge, a word which implies a special ritual or magical knowledge in place of more secular types ( khw[unavailable]m r[unavailable]). It is also used for the incantations which grant protection from gunshot wounds or which make women fall irresistably in love with one. These various types of wich[unavailable] incantation are passed on between kinsmen and close friends. Their effectiveness is to some extent dependent on the user's ritual state. It was said of the headman who had many wich[unavailable] that he would not eat tín phí, the food left over from spirit seances. [14] He had wich[unavailable] for dealing with guns, knives, women and injections. The inclusion of the latter, modern innovation on this list is interesting though in a sense incorrect. He had learnt to give injections and select medicines by reading medical manuals prepared by the main drug companies. Consequently he practised as an injection doctor without the normal ritual observance of saluting the teacher ( wai khr[unavailable]) which precedes the pronouncement of magical incantations in curing and the practice of certain other skills such as playing musical instruments.

The limited access to formal knowledge structures the official order of society. Those with access are entitled to positions and the respect that goes with them. This social function of knowledge, to qualify as a teacher, to be recognized as an expert or physician, or to be addressed as professor, learned man (acharya = aacaan), or doctor, is not only very visible but also highly satisfying. Such a person will be consulted as a repository of the knowledge to which people pay respect. The efficaciousness of that knowledge is often doubtful, but the man in need of help will at least sample the recipe. It is not expected that a teacher who hands down knowledge has great diagnostic insight in the matters about which he is consulted. He goes by rule or precedent, and even then more by analogy than by analysis. He is not curious about the situation and does not need to be — because he knows.

Traditional Thai medicine was not a single discipline but a collection of specialties: expelling spirits, setting bones, preparing medicines. Most Bang Chan practitioners of traditional medicine today know half a dozen or more specialties, learned from practitioners who were willing to share their information. One practitioner enumerated his teachers:
A priest in Bangkok taught me [as a temple boy] to make medicines for children and later how to cure adults. I spent seven years with this priest. Later, when I resigned, I lived in Bang S¯y and assisted my mother's brother who was a practitioner ( m[unavailable][unavailable]). After retiring from the police, I entered the priesthood and learned from Phra Jim how to make holy water. Later an old man named N[unavailable]j Jiam, who lived in Thonbur[unavailable], asked me to live with him. I spent fifteen days there and learned to make holy water. Next Phra Phl[unavailable]j, a priest at Bang Chan who came from Petchabur[unavailable] Province, also taught about making holy water. His elder brother, Phra Plasai, also taught me how to make holy water and mix medicines. He lived in Kanchanabur[unavailable] Province but came to Bang Chan from time to time. Phra Tung lived at a Bangkok temple and taught me how to set broken bones. [LMH 6/4/53]
From each teacher he learned unique formulas and subsequently paid annual ritual thanks (waj khr[unavailable]) to these teachers in order to keep the knowledge fresh. Doubtless Sin had specialties of these kinds; a man who met him from time to time described another one of these specialties: “People came from all over to get Sin to cure them. He was keen in every disease. In the case of cholera he made a spirit house and then a storm would come. If the house collapsed, the patient would recover. If there were no wind, the patient would die” (LMH 2/6/54).

The love magic ritual specialist makes two statuettes. A wide variety of materials may be used in making the two statuettes: wood, hay, beeswax, the raw white cotton thread used in many rituals, and clay mixed with powdered bones of the dead. The name of the beloved girl is written on one statuette. That statuette is sacralized by invoking the girl's bodily aspects and elements, and her soul. On the second statuette, the specialist writes the name of the lover. Then the specialist juxtaposes the two statuettes [Page 13] in a face-to-face hugging embrace and recites Khaathaa. Following this ritual performance, the specialist buries the statuettes, tied together in the hugging position. The two are usually buried near the woman's home. For the best results, they should be buried in her backyard....
Corpse Oil, Náam man phraaj, [unknown]. The specialist employs the corpse of someone who has died violently (called Ph˘ii taaj [unknown]), preferably that of a woman who has died in childbirth (called Ph˘ii taaj [unknown] klom, [unknown]). It is important that the corpse be relatively fresh. The specialist proceeds under the cover of darkness to a corpse store-house. He and his helper (very often the suitor) obtain a suitable corpse and place it in a sitting position, leaning it against a tree or other object. As the specialist recites the proper Khaath[unavailable]a, he applies a lighted candle just under the corpse's chin and/or at the elbows. The heat causes oils and other fluids in the corpse to drip into a receptacle. If the suitor places a single drip of this oil in the girl's food, she will become totally enslaved to him upon swallowing the food. He could, alternatively, squirt a drop of this oil on any part of her body with the same result.
Although this notorious corpse oil is well-known among the Thai, I have yet to meet an informant with it in his possession. It is said that the use of corpse oil is obsolete for many reasons. The reason most often [Page 15] given is that it is too mean, for although the girl will fall hysterically in love with the suitor, she will also be crazed for the rest of her life unless aided by the right magic employed by the specialist(s). Furthermore, this ritual is more difficult to perform now since most of the corpse store-houses, especially those in Bangkok and other big cities, are well built and protected. This fearsome corpse oil is frequently mentioned in Thai love literature, including contemporary novels and movies.
Amulets and Charms, Takrùd These are miscellaneous objects sacralized by love magic specialists in elaborate ritual processes by the use of various appropriate Khaath[unavailable]a. They are highly valued by suitors and, as a result, cost a great deal of money. The Lín S[unavailable]aríkaa amulet ([unknown]), for example, is either oblong or stick-shaped. This amulet bestows charm on the owner and on his speech if he carries it with him or keeps it under his tongue.
Montra and Khaath[unavailable]a, Mon [unknown] Khaath[unavailable]a, [unknown]. Montra ([unknown]) is a chant found in the scriptures and the commentaries. Khaath[unavailable]a ([unknown]) is simply a short snatch of a long Montra. Both Montra and Khaath[unavailable]a are secret formulae, jealously guarded, revealed and taught by a famous magic specialist only to his initiated pupil. In general, the inherent qualities of all supernatural objects are considered insufficient without Montra and Khaath[unavailable]a. Pali Khaath[unavailable]a are expressed entirely in the Pali language. Pali-Thai Khaath[unavailable]a include some words of each language.
Cosmetics, [unknown] S[unavailable]m [unknown]. Sacralized lip wax and sacralized face powder are well-known cosmetics associated with the gaining of affection, love, and popularity. They must be sacralized by the specialist who uses the appropriate Khaath[unavailable]a. Some materials obtained from the dead, such as powdered bones and beeswax used in the ritual washing of the corpse are said to be mixed with the cosmetics. Beeswax is applied either as lip gloss or foundation for lipstick. The powdered bones are mixed with face and body powder....
The Love Magic Specialist, [unknown] Sanèe Jaa [unknown]. The love magic specialist makes many of the objects described in the preceding section: love dolls, tied and buried statuettes, flower insects, corpse oil, amulets and charms, Montra and Khaath[unavailable]a, and sacralized cosmetics. In addition, the specialist supervises and guides the use of the letter diagrams, sacralized cigarette smoke, coupling philtres, and the engraved flag. A majority of the specialists are males of lower status and income who are literate but not well educated. Most specialists know some Pali and Sanskrit words. They are consulted and paid by their customers, but they are not publicly and permanently respected. They are considered disgusting and are avoided by the majority of people in the society....
In 1971, while I was living in Bangkok near the Victory Monument [unknown] and teaching anthropology at Ramkhamhaeng University [unknown], I happened to give a ride to a woman who was going to consult a Thai Muslim love magic specialist. The woman, whom I shall call [unknown] ([unknown]), was a neighbor of mine at the time. [unknown] wanted a ride to H[unavailable]a Màag, where Ramkhamhaeng University is situated, but she confided that she really intended to see a love magic specialist. Although she did not let me accompany her all the way to her destination, she explained to me that her husband was planning to leave her for another woman. Since [unknown] and her husband were the co-owners of a beauty salon, [unknown] business and income would be split, and she faced a difficult financial situation. She said that she was seeking advice from a ritual specialist named Waaháb ([unknown]), a Thai Muslim who lived in the H[unavailable]a Màag area. ...

Undoing the Effectiveness of the Original Magic, [unknown] n Mon Sanèe, [unknown]. When an individual falls hysterically in love with a particular person, his or her relatives generally assume that he or she is the victim of love magic. They seek the services of a ritual specialist and also take the victim to the respectable monks at the temple. The person who suffered from love magic listens to Buddhist chants from the Pali and Thai texts and obtains Montra Water to drink and to be sprinkled with. In this process, the monks are regarded as Monk Doctors ([unknown] Phrá, [unknown]).
The secular ritual specialists employ more complicated methods. The specialists who can undo love magic are those who can also make love magic items. In undoing the love magic, the specialist might elect to treat the case by the same kind of complex homepathic magic that caused the original trouble. For example, he may make Tied Statuettes (Phùug Hùn, [unknown]), sacralizing and validating them, but then he cuts the string, thereby undoing the effectiveness of the original magic. Or the specialists may try to find the original objects that caused the love magic and destroy those objects, such as Love Dolls and Tied Statuettes mentioned above.
If love magic cannot be undone by any method, the victim has to be kept in the confined area of the family home. In some seriously hysterical cases, the victim of love magic is chained and watched closely. This is [Page 25] because if the victim is a woman, she may run away or elope with her man. If the victim is a young man or a husband, he might marry a woman his family does not approve of, such as a prostitute, or he could bring his mistress (usually from a lower class than he and his principal wife) into the house or bequeath family property to her. However, a married man is free to do anything he wishes, especially if he himself is the head of the family and his parents are either old or already dead. In such cases his wife will seek the advice and practice of a love magic specialist or use Coupling Philtre, or find secular ways to win his heart.

Farmers who can afford to pay for elaborate ceremonies may decide, before a child is born, to have the place of confinement purified and protected. They invite a ritual specialist, who can be a Buddhist monk or an older layman, to do this. The specialist strings a white cotton thread, known as s[unavailable]ajs[unavailable]n 1 , around the place of confinement in the form of a square, several feet off the floor level. Whenever such a cord is placed around an area or an object it underlines the sacredness of that which is enclosed. The ritual specialist sacralizes a bowl of water, by reciting from memory sacred verses in the P[unavailable]li language whilst holding a lighted candle above the surface of the water in the bowl. During this recitation, the specialist holds the candle at such an angle that it drips was on to the surface of the water. After sacralization, the water is known as ‘ mantra-water’, or námmon. Immediately after námmon has been prepared, it can be sprinkled in and around the area of confinement. The householder may keep some of the námmon to extinguish the fire that traditionally formed an essential part of the post-natal treatment.
In order to ward off evil influences, the ritual specialist may have prepared different kinds of sacred objects: small banners and magical drawings. The banners are usually made of gaily coloured pieces of paper cut in the shape of a triangle and fastened by one side to a small stick. The magical drawings, known as jan 2 , are usually made on paper or on cloth. Often they consist of intricate geometrical designs in which, at regular intervals, small characters in sacred script are inserted. Both the banners and the jans are placed above and around the place of confinement. ...
An elaboration of the ceremony of the wimmowing basket, three days after birth, consists of a ceremony known as thamkhw[unavailable]n. A ritual specialist invokes non-human powers to come and assist in the ritual. In order to cause these non-human agents to assist he folds some bajs˘ii, conical structures folded from banana leaves, places on top of each of these an egg. Around the bajs˘ii, other foods which the powers like, such as bananas, and sweetmeats are placed in the vicinity.
The ceremony is intended to strengthen the khw[unavailable]n of the child. Khw[unavailable]n is difficult to translate into English, it may mean ‘ego’, ‘soul’, ‘morale’, ‘grace’, or ‘prosperity’. In order to increase the courage and reassure the sould of the infant, it is dressed with glittering ornaments and the whole family, forming a circle around the child, wafts smoke from three lit candles towards the centre. During the ritual, the specialist binds a piece of cotton string around the wrist of the baby, anoints the child's forehead and implores the soul of the child to be unwavering, to stay firm, and to enjoy its pleasant surroundings.

When a young man has decided upon a certain 'aacaan sàg, he must approach this ritual specialist with proper deference in order to make an appointment for the first session of tattooing. Often the 'aacaan sàg will decide that a Tuesday or a Saturday is the most appropriate because reputedly on such days of the week the ‘spirits are strong’. On the appointed day, the young man must come to the house of the tattooer, carrying a candle, some flowers and the fee. Payment for these types of magical services should traditionally be connected with the number six. Older people remember the days when they used to pay six [unknown], which is equivalent to 1 ½ baht, but nowadays the fee is often six baht or a plural number of six baht. The young boy should kneel down with his face towards the east, light the candle and incense and offer them together with the flowers to the ‘teachers’, those who in the dim past handed down the knowledge of tattooing. This ceremony is called wâajkhruu, and is also [Page 86] performed by the 'aacaan sàg. It is a common ritual also among Thai actors, dancers, musicians and boxers.

The standard belief is that when a woman gives birth to a still-born perfect non-decaying miniature baby, she and her husband keep the matter a secret. Above all, they take pains lest the news become known among doctors, for a doctor would then covet the Still-Born Ghost inside the little corpse, and “call” the ghost out of the corpse. The doctor does this because he wants this valuable ghost to come and live with him, be nurtured (líang) by him, remain under his control, and help him earn money by serving clients in a variety of ways. If the baby's corpse begins to decay, this would be considered prima facie evidence that a doctor (or other skilled person) had learned about it, and, using a khaathaa, had “called” the ghost out of the corpse.
It sometimes happens that a doctor will somehow or other obtain, not only the Still-Born Ghost, but also the corpse in which it is embodied. As a mark of respect, the doctor will always keep the diminutive corpse in a suitable receptacle — probably air-tight and animal-proof — and place this receptacle on a high shelf. Visitors are sometimes permitted to inspect the corpse. Thus, in one nearby wat, Monk Doctor Ernest, a relatively acculturated, highly educated former school teacher, owns such a corpse, which [Page 352] he keeps in a glass case. At another wat farther away, one of the monks owns the corpse of a Chinese infant said to have been still-born. The owner claims that he “found” it one day, and noted its remarkable undecomposed condition. [It is possible, of course, surreptitiously to embalm such a corpse, for embalming fluids are available in Bangkok.] Villagers have gone to that wat to see the corpse and consult the monk doctor. The visitor desiring a prediction on a problem can, if he wishes, obtain from the doctor a containerful of numbered divinatory sticks (sˇan tîw). 21.4 In the presence of the corpse, he shakes these sticks until one drops out of the container — bearing the number of a printed prediction slip which the visitor then obtains from the doctor. The supernatural power or influence (ìdthìríd) from the Still-Born Ghost is believed to have been transferred to, or invested in, the numbered sticks — rendering the resulting prediction especially accurate (mâen).

Changes in health, hygiene, and sanitation were also dramatic. The use of soap for personal hygiene, and detergents for laundering, increased from close to zero in the early Fifties to almost 100 percent in 1970. Water-seal privies, rare in 1957, became commonplace. While epidemic diseases had already been brought under control by 1957, much further progress was made in reducing the [Page 692] incidence of various communicable diseases. On the curative side, by 1957 the antibiotic revolution was well under way; it continued apace. During the Sixties the government opened a health station in Bang Chan itself, staffed by a resident modern midwife. Inexorably, more and more of the villagers began to favor this midwife, or various modern practitioners and facilities in Minburi or Bangkok — to the virtual demise of local “traditional” doctors and midwives. Infant mortality rates dropped, as did, incidentally, the percentage of Bang Chan mothers who practiced “lying near the fire” (jùu faj) after parturition. In 1957 birth control pills were not yet available, nor was much birth control practiced by males. By 1970, an estimated ten to twenty percent of the husbands had had vasectomies, and probably at least half of the wives had used oral contraceptive pills at one time or another.

People quickly proceed to call a medical practitioner if /169/ it has become apparent that their own home remedies have not been of any benefit. In many cases it is a priestess who is invited to come to look at the sick person (X, 26). But people do not proceed to do it too quickly, because more expense is connected with it. Sometimes one has a priestess come for a sick child in order to napapaoepi koemoe or napapapoe’a woekotoe it. The first means “to let sit on the blanket.” For this the child stands in front of the priestess, who touches various parts of the sick body with a foeja /beaten tree bark/ blanket. Finally she puts the blanket on the child’s head and then moves it up and down seven times. In front of the sick one lies a chopping knife wrapped in a rain mat, an object that is called êmpehi and is used on other occasions. Now the priestess taps against the knees seven times, after which the child goes to sit on the êmpehi . She then declares: Mapoe’a woekotoenja , “his knees have been broken” (i.e., I have broken his knees). This is done both with boys and with girls.
Besides the priestess, in each village there are several men and women about whom it is known that for certain indispositions they are familiar with a remedy that has already been applied with success many times. Such a person is then asked to come to try his skill on the sick person. If his remedy appears to have no effect, then people try another medical practitioner. Friendly acquaintances and relatives often voluntarily offer to administer to the sick person a remedy that they have become acquainted with through a dream or through one fortuitous circumstance or another.
If such a medical practitioner has acquired a reputation, then he is called sando . Inviting a sando is simpler than getting a priestess. It may happen that the one called does not wish to come because he has something against one of the members of the family to which he is called. The mutual relationship of the villagers is often not of a friendly nature, because people are quick to step on one another’s toes. Custom prescribes that, in case of a refusal, a duit, a piece of foeja, and a chicken (or a piece of cotton) be taken to the unwilling medical-expert. These three things bear the name of aoe tatogo , “the three.” In other circumstances, too, an unwilling person is persuaded by “the three” to perform one service or another, for example, to bear witness in a lawsuit. After the offering of “the three,” one will no longer refuse to accept the invitation, even though it is done with aversion, because otherwise public opinion would be turned against him. The person making the request is then also justified in fining the one who refuses, because he is considered “guilty.” Payment is made for all the medicines furnished, because without payment they would be powerless. This price for medicines furnished is called ojoti mpakoeli , “for the ceasing, telling to stop ( maojoti ) the treatment.”

The Toradja also knows from experience that the use of palm wine makes wounds smart. They have had the same experience with the use of pork. “Pork is sharp,” says the Toradja; for that reason it is prohibited during sickness. It is strange that for the same reason no foods that are mixed with anything from the coconut may be eaten: from the coconut, oil is prepared; this reminds one of pork fat; therefore both must be equally harmful. A sick person has to abstain from Spanish pepper, for this is hot and, in his opinion, makes the blood warm, i.e., unhealthy.
Someone who has a skin ailment does not eat chicken, fish, or maize. Not the first, because the feet of a chicken are scaly; and fish too. These scales are strongly reminiscent of the scales that come off the skin, for example, in connection with ichthyosis (scale sickness). He abstains from maize because it has skins that come loose when the kernels are pounded and which are also reminiscent of skin scales....
In contrast to this a number of foods are never forbidden for a sick person by a native medical expert. Among these there is in the first place rice; among the vegetables, mustard, nambo ( Sinapis alba ), for montambo means “to leave in the lurch, to forsake”; the sickness will leave the patient. And tambata jopo , a kind of mushroom, is never forbidden for sick persons.

The reasons why children are born dead or die soon after birth are for the Toradja the same as those causing a difficult birth: quarreling, mistakes made at the solemnization of the marriage, and the like. The reason may also lie in the fact that husband or wife has a birthmark ( ila ) on the genitals, or that the woman has something wrong ( patoela , “mark”) in her body. In the former case, if husband or wife lets the spouse see the birthmark this is sufficient to life its disastrous effect. In the latter case, a person expert in these things ( sando ) must cut or whisk the “wrong” from the body (XI, 11).
373 In order to find out whether during the next confinement the woman will again bring into the world a child incapable of living, there is divining: an expert throws medicine at the woman’s head without her noticing it; if he succeeds in touching her crown, the next child will remain alive. Or the resin of a torch is mixed with herbs and lighted. Then the torch is addressed: “If you see that the child will remain alive, then continue to burn if I cover you; if you see that it will die quickly or be born dead, then go out.” After that a cooking pot is set above the resin for some time.

The Iban are highly egalitarian people and every bilek family shares a strong regard for its independence and the personal reputation of its members. Nevertheless, those who distinguish themselves or enjoy outstanding material success, and their descendants, are accorded considerable respect by other persons. The Iban take pride in their family ancestry and their connections with renowned leaders and pioneers of past generations. Extensive genealogical histories ( tusut ) are preserved and orally transmitted by expert genealogists ( tukang tusut ) and by means of these histories, ancestory may be traced, in some instances, over as many as thirty generations. In addition to the status of ordinary individuals and those of outstanding achievement, the Iban also recognised two categories of hereditary servitude in the past. At the end of the present chapter, I mention these and describe the legal and ceremonial means by which war captives ( ulun ) and debt-slaves ( jaum ) were formerly freed by the mutual agreement of the slave and his or her master.

When the recitation is over, the representatives who speak from the bride's and bridegroom's sides will ask a person who is expert in genealogy to set forth the pedigree for the information of the people regarding the relationship between the bride and bridegroom. This will facilitate the discussion on appropriate customs in case they may cause disaster.
First and foremost, the genealogist is given rice today or arrack, and then he will recite the following before setting forth the pedigree thus: ...
After finishing the drink (literally, “sharpening water”), the appointed genealogist holds nipah leaves (for rolling tobacco in) with which he sets forth the pedigree. He starts his pedigree by taking Sengalang Burong as the basis because from there he will be able to relate the marriage customs originating from the marriage of Sengalang Burong's son, Aji, whose chivalry is beyond the moon, Suka Raja Rengayan, who was married to Endu Anggu Kaul Ketapu, Endu Kuku Anyam Saribu, the daughter of Simpulang Gana and Endu Endun Serentum Tanah Tumboh, lying exposed to the sunshine at the middle of the country, Endu Iyak Cherindak Tanggui Buloh, hovering over the neighbouring farms. Starting from there, he will also relate the first time Raja Simpulang Gana demanded Sengalang Burong to give him a dowry of a fowl of the size of a sparrow which had spurs coiled onto its knees, a pig as big as a rat that had tusks coiled onto the tuft of bristles on the head of that certain pig, and a black jar with a sprout together with a gong.
In addition, he also recites the customs regarding marriage in defiance of the generation taboo which is disastrous, following Sengalang Burong's advice which he gave to his grandson, Sera Gunting who committed incest with his mother's sister, Endu Dara Chempaka Tempurong Alang alias Dayang Patri Langit. After he has related those customs, he then begins to set forth his pedigree further and gives information regarding his forefathers' expensive dowries as they were rich and chivalrous. On reaching the generation of the bride and bridegroom, he then discloses their relationship. The people will discuss the appropriate customs to remedy the marriage which might happen to be in defiance of the generation [Page 35] taboo, after the genealogist has set forth his pedigree up to that stage. If their relationship is calculated from their parents, and is in the ratio of one to two (which means that he is married to his auntie or niece), then the water is being partitioned for them, and two pigs will be slaughtered: one is to be killed in the water while the other will be butchered on land. They are requested to bathe themselves with the water that has been saturated with the blood of the pigs. The pigs to be slaughtered must be the ones that have had litters, and the jar that the bridegroom produces must be equivalent to the monetary value of nine dollars while the bride pays seven dollars. (Other customs are obtainable from a book entitled “Sengalang Burong”.)

Without venturing to comment on the kinship significance of tusut , it should be noted that an Iban may record his ancestry back through both male and female forbears, as he sees fit. There is no limit to the number of tusut lines any individual may trace back from himself, except his own capacity for genealogical detail. At the lower or more recent end of the tusut , one who is a skilled genealogist ( tukang tusut ) will be informed on the exact nature of relationship to relatives at least as distant as third or fourth cousins. Iban society, tusut are essential to the solution of many questions, from determining whether a marriage is incestuous to settling a fruit-tree dispute. The parents of a marriageable daughter may be able to claim a higher bride price if they can document the existence of famous forbears -- pioneers, warleaders or politicians. A host will not be certain of how to treat his guest until he is aware of kin relationship, or lack thereof.
The complete flexibility with which a knowledgeable Iban may select from innumerable lines of ancestors those whom he wishes to include in any given tusut recitation, makes for a system which may be manipulated as circumstances require. Writing a century ago, the second Brooke Rajah described how two recently hostile groups of Ibans set about to reinforce a government-sponsored peace-making ceremony:...

The first leader to settle in the Skrang river was Lau Moa, 21 whose name means ‘withered face’. He is a mysterious figure, best known for his children. His daughter, Lantong, was the mother of Tindin, the famous leader of migration into the Paku (see below). But he also had six sons, who were famous bards.
They became skilled as bards because their father, Lau Moa, had once given a gawai burong (bird festival) to which, in accordance with Iban custom, he invited the ancestors and Gods from the spirit world, including Sengalang Burong. But Sengalang Burong was very critical of the pengap or song, which Lau Moa sang to summon the guests from the spirit world. To set matters right, he sent his own bard, Sampang Gading, to teach Lau Moa's sons how to sing the pengap properly. The first son to learn from Sampang Gading was Sumbang, and he later taught his five brothers. All six of them became very skilled at this important kind of singing.

No doubt tensions and antagonisms do exist between Iban men and women, just as in any society. To see this, however, as evidence for a collective envy of men, on the part of Iban women, is perhaps to go a little too far (Freeman 1968:388). Contemporary Iban describe the sexual banter at headhunting festivals as “play” ( main-main ), and men themselves willingly participate n the role reversal farce, collecting firewood and forest vegetables, which they then cook, in imitation of the domestic duties of Iban women. Furthermore, one finds that many Iban women express little interest in the status-seeking self-aggrandizement of their menfolk, preferring instead to concentrate on achieving recognition in their own domain as expert weavers and ritual specialists in the art of dyeing cloth (Gavin; private communication). The latter attitude can, of course, be interpreted as symptomatic of a suppressed rivalry between men and women, where by thwarted women reject a dominant male ideology and replace it with a value system of their own.

In Iban society, the spear ( sangkoh ) is identified with headhunting and warfare, while the weaving heddle ( letan ) stands for their female counterpart - the design and manufacture of woven fabrics ( pua' ). This equation of male headhunting on the one hand, with female weaving, on the other, is found throughout Iban culture. Thus in Iban oral literature, the headhunting heroes of Panggau Libau, marry the women weavers of Gellong, while in real life, women who are skilled in weaving are identified with men who have been on the warpath and who have taken heads. In particular, those women who are experienced in the ritual preparation of mordants used in the dyeing of cloth ( indu' tau' nakar, tau' ngar ) are said to be the female equivalent of great war-leaders ( orang tau' serang ). And just as young men were traditionally not considered eligible for marriage until they had taken their first head, or at least been on the war-path (Leach 1950:70), neither could Iban maidens be properly considered for marriage until they had demonstrated their accomplishments at weaving pua' ’ (Howell 1912:64).

When a new settlement is founded, the forest in its immediate vicinity is felled first, and as long as farms lie within a radius of about half a mile to a mile (or slightly further, if they can be reached by canoe), activities are conducted from the main long-house. After a few years however, as more distant land is brought into cultivation, accessibility becomes a problem, and when this stage is reached the community breaks up into a number of distinct groups--each group farming in a different part of the long-house territory. Typically, the whole community moves to the same general quarter of the territory, where each group takes over the pioneering of a small (i.e. unnavigable) tributary stream. These arrangements are decided upon at a series of conferences ( baum ) in which all the bilek families of the community participate. A proposal to farm new land is first mooted by several closely related bilek families (i.e. containing siblings, first or second cousins), and usually such a group will have a leader who, although he is never formally appointed, plays a major part in the inauguration and planning of the venture. Ideally he is a man skilled in the taking of auguries. Other families develop parallel plans, and gradually several groups are formed. In size these groups vary from two to ten or more different bilek families, depending largely on the extent of the area in which they propose to farm.

The pelian chants examined here depict the manang as one whose special expertise is in promoting beneficial interactions and separations between various natural and supernatural elements of the cosmos. The invocations acknowledge the benevolent intercession of the petara in the life of human beings and call forth the celestial manang for assistance in healing rites, but against this background the terrestrial manang is portrayed as essentially an actor, rather than a medium. As practitioners who draw on the repertoire of categorical distinctions made by the Iban, quintessentially those concerning matter and spirit, the manang are depicted intentionally moving themselves and other creatures across this dichotomy. Thus the pursuit of errant souls images, in terms of the immediate natural environment, the manangs unseen actions in retrieving lost souls and dealing with spirit adversaries. The sacrifice of a fowl exploits the cultural categorization of living things, as a borderline creature is incorporated into the human sphere, then dispatched, in order to satisfy the antu without loss of ‘real’ life. Finally, the pelian bejereki involves the construction of barriers, the bridging of realms, and the physical representation of the intangible.
In this chapter, I explore the activities of the manang in Iban ritual. By way of introduction, I note the range of Iban healing practices and mention some aspects of manang performances, after which I comment on the manang 's role in the neutralization of inauspicious omens and dreams. I then examine the tasks a manang undertakes in pelian rites, delineating the cultural logic which ascribes efficacy to his or her actions. Following this, I consider the content and meaning of saut rites. Finally, I conclude this chapter with an examination of the initiation rites ( bebangun ), which are thought to confer on the manang the special skills attributed to them.
When an Iban was ill, traditionally the first thing the family would do in their endeavour to effect a cure was celebrate a bedara mata or bedara mansau ceremony. Richards defines bedara as ‘make offering and sacrifice to accompany prayer ( pedara )’ and says mata means ‘raw, uncooked, unripe’ while mansau means ‘ripe, cooked’ (1981:32, 208-209). At bedara , as Sandin puts it, ‘offerings are made to the deities and the spirits of past manangs , so that they will come to treat the sick person with miracles and spiritual charms’ (1980:43). Masing, who considers bedara the least complex of all Iban rituals (1981:34), describes it as a rite in which ‘a person of standing in a community’ prepares an offering ( piring ) (1981:35) or sacrifices a four-footed animal ‘to secure a human life’ (1981:36). Thus, at bedara ceremonies, the Iban make offerings in order to oblige reciprocal spirit assistance, and perform sacrifices which provide substitute ‘lives’ to satisfy malevolent spirits.
If the bedara was not successful, the family would then call a manang to perform a pelian ceremony. The manang 's first task is diagnostic: he/she endeavours to determine the nature of the complaint, the cause of the illness and any involvement of spirits. To do so, it is essential to ascertain the condition and the whereabouts of the patient's semengat . Having made a diagnosis, the manang decides on appropriate remedial action (Jensen 1974:146-147). Sandin lists the Iban names of numerous pelian ceremonies which might be performed (1980:43, 1983:250). In each, he says, ‘the manang invites [the celestial] Menjaya Raja Manang and the souls of great manangs of the past to come to assist him with charms and miraculous healing’ (1980:43). At the conclusion of the rite, the manangs may seek to divine its success by examining a flower bud of the areca palm (Sandin 1978:78-79 n.6) or by observing whether a roughly carved wooden figure ( pentik ), stuck into the ground at the foot of the longhouse ladder, remains upright or inclines to either side by the morning following the rite (Perham 1887:97-98).
Perham reports that the manang ‘never performs in daylight unless the case is very bad’, for to do so is considered ‘difficult and dangerous work’ (1887:89-90). Sandin says most pelian are held at night, beginning after the evening meal is finished (1978:58). This timing accords with the notion that reversals characterize the land of the dead ( Sebayan ), so that when it is daytime in the world of the living, it is night in the land of the dead and vice versa (Uchibori 1978:236). Thus, the shaman, who ventures into the realm of spirits to overtake a soul on the way to Sebayan , considers it safer to do so when it is light in that place. Jensen extends this idea of reversals to account for blindness or poor sight as an asset for a manang . As he puts it, ‘the physical handicap of blindness ... becomes an asset in dealings with the spirit world, indeed enables the manang to see the spirits where others cannot’ (1974:145).
The manang is equipped with a medicine basket or box ( lupong ) in which he/she keeps a variety of objects ‘including pieces of tusk, wood, root, stone, crystal and glass’ (Jensen 1974:146). These items include medicinal charms and possibly [Page 50] ingredients for herbal medicines. According to Brooke Low, some manang would add to their medicine box ‘European medicines procured from the Government dispensary, for they are wide awake and ready at all times to avail themselves of remedies of known efficacy’ (Ling Roth 1896:I,266-267). However, while the manang may practise herbal medicine, they do not do so qua manang and herbal remedies are not part of shamanic rites as such (Freeman, personal communication, 15 December 1982). Nor are medicinal charms the exclusive prerogative of the manang as any Iban may possess such charms, the whereabouts of which are usually revealed in a dream by benevolent spirits. ...
Should the pelian rituals fail to cure the sick person, the family may then hold a gawai sakit (ritual festival for the sick) at which a group of bards ( lemambang ) recite the pengap invocatory chant (Sandin 1980:43). As described by Perham (1882:136) and Richards (1981:326), the bards' invocation is combined with the manang 's performance of saut rites, the [Page 51] ‘[f]ullest rites for the sick performed by MANANG when PELIAN rites have failed’ (Richards 1981:326). ...
If divination indicates that no cure has been effected by this ritual festival, then, in a form of the practice termed nampok , the sick person might be left alone with offerings at a solitary place thought to be inhabited by spirits. Recognizing ‘that his illness is beyond human cure’ (Sandin 1980:43), he hopes the spirits of the place will come to his aid. Finally, ‘[i]f he cannot be cured, he awaits death’ (Sandin 1980:43).

A girl learns to weave from her mother or grandmother. The secret of the designs are kept within the family. A skilled weaver may work in complete secrecy, hiding her work until it is completely finished. Each woman has her own exclusive repertoire that may include as many as a hundred different designs. A woman may sell her designs at a price, but in so doing forfeits her copyright (Gill 1968:153). Originality in design is a criterion of excellence and every woman seeks to develop new patterns. For example, Mene in the Timang Gawai Amat is praised for the uniqueness of the waistband she weaves for Lang, the god of war (Masing 1981:355).
Women weave not only to provide their menfolk with ceremonial jackets and waistbands, but also for their bilik family. The Iban family requires woven textiles for a number or ritual purposes, including various agricultural festivals, the Feast of the Whetstones, and festivals for warfare and the dead (Gittinger 1979:217; Sandin 1976:46). Large woven blankets ( pua ) are placed underneath offerings or used to delineate and protect a ritual area, to screen a corpse on the veranda, or to cover a newborn child on its first ritual meeting with its grandmother (Sandin 1976). Perhaps the most significant use of the pua in the context of this discussion is in the rituals attached to the headhunting cult, when a woman skilled in weaving receives the trophy head, the symbol of bravery, tanda berani , on a specially woven cloth ( pua kumbu muau [Sather 1977:xv]).
Woven textiles have mystical qualities. The Iban use them as protection from evil spirits and physical enemies and as a means of communication with the spirit world: a shaman requires a bidang or woven skirt as a fee for transporting a soul to the world beyond and to ensure a safe return from the underworld (Howell 1911:7). The Timang Gawai Amat contains several references to the jacket of Lang, dexterously woven (Masing 1981:283) in a superb pattern with a frog motif (1981:283). This jacket will make Lang invincible (1981:178, 145). The spiritual qualities of woven textiles is also illustrated by a myth in which one of [Page 246] Lang's daughters marries a mortal and weaves him and their son “jackets of birds” to enable them to fly and join her in heaven (Howell 1909:186-187).
The Iban believe that designs have a certain ritual power and may harm a woman who tries to weave them. To protect herself, a woman may use special charms and make an offering of betel nuts and eggs to Kumang before beginning to weave (Masing 1981:436). An apprentice weaver is particularly vulnerable and must rely on the assistance of an older woman to tie the dangerous part of the textiles (Vogelsanger 1980:117). A woman's repertoire of designs may be limited by ritual prescriptions, which only the spirits can lift. When Nangku anak Dingat was almost fifty years old, for example, Kumang told her that she could weave any design she wanted ( nadai pemali ). This initiated her career as a master weaver. Her pua were much sought in her longhouse and she wore a porcupine quill adorned with several warp threads in her hair (Edric Ong 1986:26).
Dyeing cotton thread is also a difficult ritual process, which perhaps only one out of fifty women master. Restrictions similar to those enforced during childbirth are imposed, and the process is said to take place covertly, away from the gaze of men. 9 Dyeing has been described as kayau indu , “the warfare of women.” A woman who is skilled in dyeing is called indu gaar or indu takar , a status similar to that of a war chief ( tau serang ) (Sather 1977a:xv).
Unfortunately, not enough is known about the functioning and order of women's status differentiation in weaving. A skilled woman is paid handsomely for her services to other women who require dyed thread (Haddon and Start 1982:22). Through success in weaving, women achieve recognition of their maturity, some specific ritual honors in gawai festivals, such as receiving a skull or decorating the kelingkang pole (Sather 1977a:xv), and the distinction of having tattoos on their fingers (Komanyi 1972:102). It is also said that a husband can earn recognition and honor in certain rituals though his wife's status as a weaver.
In traditional Iban society, then, women are not subordinated by a male value system that emphasizes prestige in warfare. This is because they have the power to manipulate their position in relationship to the male system through their facility to endorse, challenge, or represent alternative values. It is in their interest to recreate the male value system through the indoctrination of male infants and boys, because trophy heads mean abundant rice harvests. Women are able to shift their position in relation to the male prestige system because their gender identity is located outside the system in their knowledge of weaving. As weavers, women play a vital part in protecting the life, health and fertility of the community, objectives shared by men as warriors.
The idiom of weaving articulates the cultural construct of femaleness in Iban society, in opposition to warfare and maleness. This is conveyed in myth, ritual, and oral literature through imagery of fertility, life, love, and sexuality, which are alternative ideals to bravery and warfare but still in the interests of the goals of the community. Knowledge of weaving and dyeing is held exclusively by mother and daughter. Each design is the original work of one woman, inspired by the spirits. Through their relationship with the spirit world, the [Page 248] textiles women weave mediate between heaven and earth. If a woman successfully establishes a relationship with the spirit world, she will be able to weave designs that will earn her adult status and, moreover, recognition as an expert weaver.

In former times, however, if a blood relationship could be proved among the Ibans, it sometimes helped to maintain and [Page 40] justify peaceful relations between two groups. The documents used to prove relationship were oral genealogies ( tusut ), memorized by recognized experts ( tukang tusut ). From a political point of view, the most interesting thing about an Iban genealogy is that it could be traced back through any of innumerable lines of ancestors to establish a desired relationship. At ten generations back in time, even two people from rather widely separate areas were likely to have quite a number of common forbears. If the genealogist was skilled and determined enough, he could find them.

Whatever the reasons may have been, the Iban neither raised nor supported permanent leaders. With the Iban oriented to independence and the achievement of the individual, to the autonomy of the bilik -family, and to a year-to-year subsistence based upon shifting cultivation of rice with little if any surplus, there was no place for non-contributing leaders. Leaders who were recognized were of an ad hoc nature, such as the war leader ( tuai serang ), who secured his position through bravery in battle; the house elder ( tuai rumah ), who adjudicated disputes and helped co-ordinate community activities; the genealogist ( orang tau tusut ), consulted when marriages were arranged; the bard ( lemambang ), who was invited to chant and magically ensure the efficacy of various ritual occasions; the augur ( tuai burong ), skilled in reading bird flights and other signs to predict the unpredictable outcome of farming, raids, and trips; and the shaman ( manang ), the medium-healer of psychic and physical illnesses.

The religion has certainly operated to discourage scientific investigation and the progress of arts and technology. For example: the Ifugao’s medical knowledge is little more than nil and lies principally in the setting of broken bones and the reduction of dislocations. The art descends from ancestor to son or, in some cases, daughter. Some of the bone-setters do a fairly good job of opposing the ends of fractures. I was once talking to a young practitioner, a bright enough fellow by natural endowment, but a conservative in the art. He belittled the art of bone manipulation: “The prayer is the important thing,” he said, “the prayer and the sacrifice. If these be right, the recovery will be right.”

For the Ifugaos, a knowledge of pedigrees is of paramount importance. Tribal priests ( mombaki) pass on the knowledge of a clan’s genealogy ( tupon) from one generation to the next. Indeed, some priests-experts are able to provide genealogies for ten or eleven generations which include descendants in both lines of certain important ancestors. Thus, at an early age, children are taught the family genealogy, which may include relatives to the tenth degree on both the father’s and the mother’s sides. A functional knowledge of one’s lineage easily determines whom to invite for religious feasts and other gatherings which require the presence of relatives.
During the prestige feast ( baya; bumaya) the most knowledgeable of the clan’s genealogists identifies the people to be invited. The hosts’ representatives ( munila) go from one village to another beating their gongs and at the same time extending the invitation to the relatives—familiar and unfamiliar. The knowledge of the clan’s lineage, however, is commonly applied when a member needs assistance. When a person dies, all his relatives are expected to attend the vigil while the closest kin contribute money, pigs, or carabaos for the sacrifices ( honga). Most of all, the knowledge of the tupon strengthens the unity and mutual defense among the members. Many conflicts are avoided and others are solved when the concerned parties realize that they are of the same family origin.

If there were an impression at an earlier time that doctors tended to vegetate in the Highlands and fail to keep up to date, it has now been dispelled because they have chance to engage in study leave and the relation with the specialists is now so close-knit. The observer of the wide Highland situation cannot help comparing the progress of this happy, vigorous, well-integrated Service with the tempo of what should be an equally important and health-supporting rehabilitative service, that of agricultural advice and education, mentioned below. The weakest link in the Highlands and Islands Medical Service is hospitalization, in that it is inadequate except at headquarters, and conditions for the nursing-staff in some of the smaller hospitals are unsatisfactory. This situation, unfortunately, is common elsewhere in the country.

Male pastors from the dominant society service most Lutheran churches in Saami areas, while Laestadian practitioners are usually recruited from the Saami and Finnish populations. Laestadian practitioners also perform in the folk-medicine arena, and are male. Self-styled shamans of both genders serve the medical and sorcery needs of their kin, friends, neighbors, and trading partners. However, not all healers are shamans, and not all shamans are healers. ...
Indigenous beliefs and practices (such as the stopping of blood) are grounded in the knowledge and skills of the patient, a family member, or a shaman. Remedies are readily available in nature for human, reindeer, and dog maladies. In addition and within limits, these sparsely settled outlying regions receive medical and veterinary services in line with those of the rest of the country.

Privately- or officially-administered abortion is an event in many women's lives. In recent years, a woman less than twelve weeks' pregnant may apply for an abortion under the Norwegian medical plan. If, after paperwork and interviews, the abortion is granted, the operation itself is carried out in a regional hospital. This entails a trip to Hammerfest or Troms[unknown] and four days' absence from home, a telltale period.
Some women prefer the risks of a folk medicinal abortion. If the procedure involves the assistance of a person besides the woman herself, it is likely to be a coastal practitioner older than herself or a woman [Page 169] of her own age and inland district. The former alternative has always been more accessible to the mobile reindeer-keeping population.
Nowadays, most privately-administered abortions involve no help from others aside from confidential suggestions for a source of mercury. The pregnant woman may then consume a pea-sized mass of quicksilver, though not always with the desired effect. Quicksilver is also swallowed as a cure for general aches and pains. Another aborting technique, never witnessed, is the insertion of instruments such as knitting needles into the womb. If unsuccessful, the fetus could reportedly continue development but be born blind or otherwise handicapped.
In almost every sii'da and neighborhood there are individuals known for their healing powers, blood-stopping, and prophecy. These persons do not administer abortions, which are -- despite everything -- openly disapproved by most, but they may be called on to control hemmorages. These local healers tend to be reindeer-keeping males and sedentary females, but few of either category attract patients from any distance.
Due to great inhibitions surrounding nakedness, it is difficult for a pregnant woman to approach either the local doctor or one of the practitioners. There are recurring instances of women and girls giving birth without having ever confided their condition to anyone other than a sister or female cousin -- or to anyone at all.

The benefits of cooperation, however, were not all one-way. When Pava-Lasse merged with Heika Gubben and the rest of the native Jokkmokk herders of the Viri Group dissolved, Pava-Lasse's use of the Tarreluoppal camp site decreased, and it became more common for him to spend all spring, summer and autumn in Stalo. Pava-Lasse no longer had access to as much labor for any bare-ground independence from the Karesuando herders. With growing extensivity, grazing utilization being confined for such a long time to one general area (Virihaure), and the presence of birch forest and good fishing, it became all the more practical to erect a permanent dwelling at Stalo, a turf k[unknown] ata , better able to give shelter in the harsh climate. Although turf k[unknown] atas were not unheard of by the Jokkmokk Saamis, few mountain Saamis had any experience with them. It was indeed the northern Saamis who, with their expertise in this construction form, helped the Jokkmokk Saamis to adapt to changing conditions. Heika Gubben helped Pava-Lasse build a turf k[unknown] ata by Lake Virihaure.

Ritual Intervention in Folk Healing Village vernacular contains abundant folk sayings characterizing women as talkers, gossips, meddlers, busy-bodies. Women’s skills with words are thought to enhance ritual interaction with chthonic forces from the dangerous netherworld. bearers of ill winds, of disorder and chaos. A folk classification of a set of illnesses is still known as devet vetrovi, the nine winds. A bajalica who cures with words mediates via her basme (oral charms) in order to dispel illness caused by one of the ill winds and thereby restore harmony. (The term bajalica can be traced to an Indo-European root cognate with “speaking out:” Pokorny 1953:105-106; Kerewsky-Halpern and Foley 1978: 903-924). In a recent study I discuss the phonology, semantics and repetitive syntactic features of these basme and the resultant trance induction, biofeedback and other psychotherapeutic benefits such sound-bound intervention may effect (Kerewsky-Halpern 1985: 319-325).
One of the important ways a bajalica mediates is by conjuring series of oral frames which function as mother metaphors. She might do this with familiar domestic animal mothers feeding their young on appropriate nourishment color-coded to match the particular wind-borne disease, e.g. the color yellow for jaundice. The bajalica, a human mother and therefore stronger than a symbolic mother, then “feeds” her patient a basma in the ritually prescribed manner. After the appropriate number of days of treatment the disease begins to wane. [Page -49-] Such ritual psychomancy enhanced by words often calls on the wolf (using the archaic term kurjak ) as co-mediator, the wolf being an agent of the devil and therefore a suitable helper for bridging the abyss from tu, “this world,” to otud, “out there” in the other world.
Throughout this form of ritual intervention the practitioner enacts her role as prototypical mother, validated by her biological attributes and rendered safe by age. To intercede in encounters with illness if not ritually clean would be unthinkable. (I myself could not be initiated into the secrets of bajanje until villagers perceived me as suitable recipient at the time that our eldest daughter became seen as a potential procreative vessel in our own family, thereby elevating me to the status of potential baba, “old woman” or fictive granny.) In function the bajalica’s mediation benefits the afflicted individual; in case of less positive outcome her intervention is recognized as harmless in any case.

A dangerous kind of ritual intervention is carried on by a vra[unknown]cara, a female practitioner who works with ritual objects more than with words. In the villages she is often known by a false name or a euphemism in order to deflect the evil eye. Encounters with a vra[unknown]cara can result in reversals of the intended outcome or in processes moving toward unanticipated outcomes. A few years ago a man who was psychologically impotent with his wife consulted a vra[unknown]cara two villages away. He visited her in secret, traveling on foot and under cover of darkness across a ravine, along mud paths skirting strips of cultivated fields. Chronologically he was [Page -50-] close in age to the practitioner. He addressed her as “ majko ”; she called him “ sinko, ” diminutive for “son.” Drawing a circle of string on the ground she instructed him to sit inside it and repeat a sequence of movements using his arm, now flexed, now extended. The circle was a female sexual symbol and the arm a symbolic penis. The vraćara soothingly told her client that she understood he was temporarily impotent with his wife because of guilt over his attentions to a local widow across the glen. The client was amazed that the vraćara knew this detail of his private life, which further confirmed his trust in her.
A year later I learned that the widow, jealous of her former lover’s attentions to his own wife, had visited the same vra[unknown]cara and had put a curse on him, rendering him impotent with all women. The widow said, “Thank God for women like her. Without her powers how would I even the score?” The man himself fumed, “That she-devil! That sorcerer! Where the devil needs someone to do his work, he sends a woman!” The vra[unknown]cara, calmly disassociating herself from claims of evil-doing said, “I ’dream up’ what I have to do,” thus absolving herself from conscious responsibility while maintaining her reputation as a woman of manipulative power.

Every morning finds a knot of people outside the health room door in the Cooperative Home, usually old men seeking pills or injections, plus mothers with sniffling children and the occasional emergency. Twice a week a doctor comes from Arandjelovac. It is becoming increasingly rare for a woman to have her baby at home. She goes to the maternity center in Arandjelovac or, if she lives in the far section of the village in the direction of Mladenovac, she uses the center there. Despite frequent resort to folk practitioners for various psychosomatic ailments and some types of infectious diseases, modern medical techniques are eagerly sought. This is so notwithstanding the fact that the private farmer must pay for certain examinations and medicines. The costs are not exorbitant, although the amount charged for long stays in the hospital can become burdensome. However, certain serious illnesses such as tuberculosis and cancer are treated free of charge. A large number of villagers, being former mine workers or presently industrial, agricultural (state) or white collar workers, are eligible for free care for themselves and their families.

In practice, the peasant is forced into a dualism which can distort the original value of institutions. As a rule he is neither so advanced that his religion, his Christianity, does not include ‘superstition’, nor so uncritical that his magic-working does not call in the help of his faith ( vera ). At the same time he reserves his magic proper—the processes in which an element of something other than religious faith and something other than human skill or clearly understood action upon matter is introduced to produce a desired semi-miraculous effect—for ends of self-interest, for instance, as distinct from a higher order of emotional or spiritual needs. However sure he may be of his magic, its use is signalled by a certain unsureness in dealing with things which he cannot see, which seem to him to be wholly or partly caused by a mysterious non-human factor, one over which he has no direct control through the senses, or force with which the ordinary man has no direct intelligible means of communication. Practices which the folk-lorist sometimes groups under one rubric, Magic, are departmentalised in peasant usage. Bajanje, for instance, is a concept which can be nearly covered by ‘exorcism’. It is the art of healing by pronouncing an incantation—almost always concerned with spirits—accompanied by gestures or action on the part of someone who has acquired a special virtue. Vra[unknown]canje, in Serbia, properly means the art of divining the cause of an illness and, usually, providing an antidote (a sympathetic cure or one based on analogy). It is a term also used in a more general sense. But we speak of ‘turning back’ a disease or spell ( zavr[unknown]cati, etc.). 1 Le[unknown]cenje is properly [Page 109] healing with herbal drugs. [unknown]Caranje ( [unknown]cinjenje, etc.) is the art of casting and removing spells, with or without the assistance of spirits. Magija is a far less common word, and is most often applied to malicious magic and demonic influences. Gatanje is simply the practice of divining and fortune telling, not necessarily providing a cure, with cards, string, beads, lead and water, etc. Every popular specialist is known to practise one particular method which has its own distinct professional name.
The magic of spirit-beings is also personally directed, and must be counteracted by similar magic. On the other hand, a number of rituals and of curses, which at first sight seem ‘magical’ in form, are not understood by the peasant at all in this way. They belong to his religious sentiments, to a sphere of reactions much more complex and much less tangible. Seasonal, family and tribal ceremonies are now part of law and custom, and reverenced with all the emotions of religion. Incidental magic, healing magic, for instance, is not custom; it is in no sense obligatory; its ends are practical and its results are foregone conclusions, barring accident. It is not founded on any sentiment of duty; it is not regularised, though what we vaguely define as religion and magic can both be served by the same ritual. The magical side, however, embraces more than anti-social purposes and is almost a substitute for personal religion, to which as a rule the peasant pays little heed. His real ‘religion’ belongs to group-practice, and so strong is this ancient instinct that group-interests and loyalties predominate over personal. The peasant may believe literally the teaching of the church, the promise of salvation, the duty of confession, the consequences of mortal sin; but custom, group-interest, can override these precepts, demand the blood of an enemy, the pursuance of vengeance, the neglect of sacraments, and all this he will sacrifice, admitting that he runs a danger of damnation and hoping that an opportunity for reconciliation will turn up later on. ... The forms of religion enter into healing practice, but seldom all the feelings associated with a religious act. Leeches, witches and sick men intercede with spirits and make offerings to them, but although there is always a fear of offending them, their status is not that of gods who are worshipped, but of mysterious beings with whom it is better to be on friendly terms. The peasant seldom has a separate word for prayer—e.g. church prayers—and exorcism or healing formula.

Some village doctors have a wide knowledge of cures; the surgeons frequently combine herbal medicine with their other arts; but of all these who treat several diseases very few use more than two dozen different drugs all told, and many more make do with two or three, sometimes saying that these will cure any and every ill. Specialisation is usual. There are specialists in skin diseases, in hernia, in cancer, in epilepsy, in typhus, in the care of wounds, in cataract, and so on. Besides which there are domestic simples known to nearly every household.
The barber class chiefly dress wounds, extract bullets, let blood, apply leeches, treat for venereal disease, and draw teeth—and all these things they do at the present time in Old Serbia and Southern Serbia and Kosovo, and in Bosnia and in Hercegovina whenever they can avoid the interference of the authorities. These barbers are mainly Mohammedans, Turks, Albanians, occasionally Greeks. It is amongst them that the elements of oriental pharmacy are found. Their practice is fairly stereotyped, and hereditary. Most of them still keep old-fashioned instruments, which have sometimes been in the family for many generations—a set of bronze cups, a cow’s horn, a circular or square cutting instrument, a tooth screw, a spring-set wart cutter, some rather rough tweezers, a wire probe, and the razors used for shaving. [Page [facing page 225]] These, with the knives of circumcision, complete the armamentarium of Turkish surgery in these parts.
The peasant doctor, on the other hand, seldom has any special instruments, but employs ordinary knives, sharp stones, crystals, thorns, lumps of sugar, needles, coins, and what he himself can make out of wood, such as splints. Here and there a special silver needle is kept for acupuncture and inoculation. Feathers are used in applying salves. The sorcerer or seeress has generally a black-handled knife, which should be made or specially or ritually prepared; and the rest of the paraphernalia is selected from objects in common use.
The barbers and travelling doctors have a fixed scale of charges, and so have many village specialists. When a man cannot pay immediately, he is required to leave a pledge. Such specialists can draw patients from a great distance, and make considerable profits, though in fear of restrictions, due, they say, to the jealousy of the gentlemen doctors. Most of them provide the drug, or prepare it specially for each patient; many keep a stock of their standard ointment or medicine; some only give advice and oral prescriptions. At Otok it was believed that the doctors would lose the protection of the vile if they charged more than a certain minimum fee. Those who write charms, and these are mostly Mohammedan hodjas, have also a fixed tariff.
Before the coming of qualified doctors to Serbia (first in 1819) who, until the foundation of the Medical Faculty at Belgrade in 1920, were trained abroad, and in early times were exclusively foreigners, the arts of healing were practised regularly by various native self-taught doctors, folk-doctors proper, and by travelling specialists, such as the kaliatroi from Epirus. These latter, whose learning was generally hereditary, travelled mostly in groups, and as far as Bosnia and Serbia. Members of this old school are still found in remoter places of the South and in Albania. In the provinces under Turkey the same system continued until very recent years, with here and there an oriental trained doctor in the towns.
Orthodox monasteries also undertook the care of sick persons, mainly the demented, but seldom offered any method of treatment other than prayer and fasting and castigation and the stocks. Even in Croatia and Slovenia, European medicine has been familiar only in larger towns. The first qualified doctors in Serbia were Greeks, Italians and Austrians, who attended the Obrenović family and a very small number of richer persons. In the early years of the nineteenth century, the National Soviet gave special privileges and diplomas to certain self-taught men, especially to those who had served as military surgeons. Mili[unknown]cević mentions Ećim Toma Kostić, the son of a village wise woman, who was made a regular army doctor with a salary, in 1806. These were all popular doctors, rather than true folk-doctors. In 1813 the official archives refer to a Greek of Smyrna at Belgrade; a gendarme who had shown skill in bone-setting and was granted a pension in 1835; a certain Sava Jovanović who applied what he had learnt from watching Dr B. C. Kunibert, a court physician; a former slave in the service of a Greek doctor at Smyrna, who specialised in skin and venereal disease—all these and others had special permission to practise. An order of 1836 fixes the fee of a visit, and provides for the free attendance of the poor. Lindermayer for this period notices three principal operations carried out by folk-doctors: amputation, lithotomy and removing films from the surface of the eye. Military records contain startling evidence of apparently successful, if rough, handling. Pirch, in 1829, says that village doctors treated accidents, where perhaps learned medicine would have advocated the loss of a limb, but which were in this manner perfectly healed without leaving any trace. In 1824 a monk Inćentije, in the region of U[unknown]zica, was reported to cut for tumours and swellings in the neck, and that not one of his patients but afterwards died or regretted it. A village doctor appears to have run a regular hospital or clinic for syphilitic patients, about 1836, and to have obtained semi-official recognition. Monasteries were required to provide for the sick and to undertake the cure of the demented [Page 227] ‘by the methods which they know’. Rich Turks also kept their own doctors, who amongst other duties prepared poisons for their enemies. Otherwise the mass of the people relied upon their village wise women and herb doctors.

A folk-doctor is reported to have cut out a cancerous growth on the upper lip and cauterised the wound with a red-hot iron. He then applied an ointment and, when the ulcer reappeared later in the same place, he inserted a piece of arsenic and bound up the wound. At the present time a doctor has become famous in Montenegro, and as far as Berane, for curing cancer ( rak ) by cutting away the growth and binding on green figs ‘with other herbs’. This method he [Page 254] is supposed to have learned from a former surgeon of the Montenegrin court, a Russian. A spreading or festering wound ( [unknown]ziva rana ) should be cut away all round to prevent it spreading. The following ointment is used specifically for a cancer: fresh butter, beeswax, water, tallow and incense are slowly heated together, and the shredded green endoderm of Sambucus nigra added; the mixture is cooked until it becomes a thick yellow mass (near Berane).

Wounds may receive different treatment according to whether they are caused by bullets, by sharp instruments, and so on. To stop the flow of blood from a wound it may be held tightly between the fingers or bound; cases in which the folk-doctor has joined a severed artery are known. ... As a note on the subject of specialisation, this surgeon remarked that a bullet could be best extracted by a barber surgeon. An Albanian of the same district said that, in the old days, and now for the matter of that, he never used anything for a wound but stale goat’s cheese, which was the best and handiest remedy, and drew out the bullet. An Albanian, practising folk-surgeon and veterinary surgeon at Vrelo, who made extensive journeys in and out of Albania and Montenegro, gave me [Page 257] the following: Heat about half a litre of olive oil and add a small piece of pine tar, the size of a walnut, a similar quantity of incense and of sheep fat, and a rather smaller lump of beeswax (he used more incense in his mixture than any other prescription known to me) and after mixing and adding these things gradually over the fire, add three herbs, which he called stog, pësmëtin and bar i hajl (‘dog’s weed’). ... Although for the treatment of cattle there was a fixed tariff, he seldom took anything unless a voluntary present or his expenses for curing a wound. A story which reflected both to his moral credit and professional code tells that he had even cured where he was owed blood.

Bandaging is generally the work of women specialists. It is most frequently found in connection with the care of the pregnant woman or afterbirth or to adjust a fallen womb. The belt or bandage generally consists of several metres of stout woven material which is wound fairly tightly, beginning low down on the back and sometimes extending beyond the navel. In Serbia, at the present time, where limitation of the family is becoming a more and more usual and even recognised practice, the foetus is expelled by a lengthy and exhausting massage, and some of the village midwives adjust bandages after the operation, and between two instalments of an operation. This is practically the only aid to healing given after an abortion. In Bosnia the following interesting customs came to my notice. As a precaution during pregnancy, in the case of a woman who has before suffered a miscarriage, for instance, she should go to a water mill and take a long grass or straw from the mill wheel, and gird herself with it, taking care for forty days afterwards not to cross running water. Or she should have a ring made out of the shoe of a dead horse and wear it round her waist next the skin.

Modernization has meant increased access to Western medical facilities. Women now give birth in hospitals rather than at home. However, for some types of illnesses, help is still solicited from a VRACAR or VRACARA. Illness may be attributed to many causes, and self-diagnosis has been important to the decision to seek help from a folk practitioner or Western-style physician

In Okop Sukkun the air is sharply punctuated by women singing lullabies to their children and by men practicing or performing their curing chants; in Ustuppu there is very little singing. Ritual specialties are vigorously promoted in Okop Sukkun, and many of the younger men are learning them; in Ustuppu, virtually all of the [curing] specialists are old men who must rely upon other communities for students, if they are to have any at all. In Okop Sukkun the two major ceremonies involving the entire community-- the puberty feast and the exorcism rite called Apsoket 6 -- are performed regularly with energy and enthusiasm; in Ustuppu interest in such activities has flagged and the ceremonies, when performed, are lax and somewhat disorganized. It has reached the point where, within the past few years, several conservative fathers from Ustuppu, anxious for the welfare of their daughters, have petitioned the village of Okop Sukkun to hold puberty feasts for them.

To correct this situation, it must first be noted that there are numerous named status positions among the Kuna (see Figure 10). At the broadest level, these may conveniently be divided into political and ritual fields (Howe 1974:Chapters 4, 5 & 6). Diagnosis and treatment of illness fall within the province of ritual, and the specialists who engage in these activities are the nele (‘seer’), the inatulet(i) (‘medicine man’), and the ikarwisit (‘knower of chants’). Aside from midwives, who concern themselves solely with deliverying babies, there are no other types of professionals involved in the curing process. 2 The masartulet (death chanter) and the kantule (puberty chanter), together with several other minor ritual specialists in the puberty ceremony, are not considered curing professionals by the Kuna. 3
2 The midwives ( muukana) should probably be called “quasi-specialists,” for they do have a recognized profession and gain status from their work. However, they are not seen by the Kuna as ‘people who know things’ in the strict sense of ritual. This is because they do not gather or prepare medicines (all they do is administer them); nor do they peform chants.
3 Masartulet (‘cane man’) chants to the spirit of the masar cane ( Cynerium sagittatum; caña blanca in Panamanian Spanish), which escorts the spirits of the dead to the Domain of the Father. The kantule -- literally ‘flute man,’ because he plays a cane flute while performing -- presides over girls’ puberty ceremonies.

Most medicine men begin their studies while in their late teens, starting with what are termed ‘small’ ( purwi) or ‘unimportant’ ( pasulit) medicines such as ‘damaged skin medicine’ ( ukka iskuet ina), ‘common cold medicine’ ( oo ina), and ‘body pain medicine’ ( apkan nunmakket ina). Later, when they have gained experience, they are allowed to handle ‘genuine’ ( sunsoket) or ‘principal” ( itualet) medicines such as ‘demon medicine’ ( nia ina), ‘midwife (pregnancy) medicine’ ( muu ina), and ‘vine (snake) medicine’ ( tupa ina). Only mature, seasoned specialists with years of training are powerful enough to confront the highly dangerous spirits with which these medicines are associated.
While all of the most distinguised medicine men control a broad spectrum of knowledge, they generally focus their attention on specialized branches, or ‘paths’ ( ikar) of [Page 146] expertise. 16 When a question such as “Who knows demon medicine?” is asked in Ustuppu, for example, the same four men will invariably be named as the leaders in the field. By the same token, a man from Okop Sukkun is recognized as the most outstanding specialist in eye ailments. Two other men from the same community, together with a specialist from Ustuppu, are the most highly respected snake medicine doctors; and so forth. Every community strives to maintain a wide variety of medical specialists, but this is difficult in the smaller villages of San Blas. Consequently, steps are sometimes taken by village elders to send specialists to other regions of San Blas or the Bayano in order to learn curing traditions which are lacking in their home communities. 17
17 Sherzer taped an interesting account by a medicine man from Mulatuppu who had just returned from the Bayano, where he had learned snake medicine. He had been sent by the community to learn this branch, which was vitally needed in Mulatuppu, on a community “scholarship” (Sherzer 1980).
Although no medical professions are full-time occupations, many specialists devote a tremendous amount of time and effort to the acquisition of skills. 18 They actively seek out experts who possess knowledge in particular areas and become their disciples. Dedicated medicine men may study under as many [Page 147] as ten or more different specialists, and sometimes travel far afield to spend months at a time expanding their knowledge with especially distinguished practitionars. In fact, the education of the most active medicine men never really ends. They often pass leisure hours discussing medicines, chants, diseases, and curing with their peers. Even men in their sixties who have already built up formidable reputations attach themselves to specialists who are well-versed in branches of medicines the former do not know.
18 In his later years, Nele Kantule of Ustuppu came close to being a full-time teacher of ritual and political tradition. He spent virtually all of his time in the village with his students, and seldom worked in his fields.

The men of Kuna households engage in subsistence activities which usually take them away from the community early in the morning, and when they return in the afternoon they [Page 175] characteristically go about small tasks around the house, rest, or visit with friends. Because the women so thoroughly monopolize the patient, they are clearly in the best position to know what his or her problems are. Occasionally, a specialist will appear to question the patient directly, but the women are invariably the ones who carry out most of the detective work. They study the symptoms, reconstruct the past few days, and dredge up relevant facts from the patient’s biography. They discuss their findings among themselves, while neighboring women, lured to the scene with hopes of uncovering the latest gossip, drop by to offer their opinions. Households in which someone has recently fallen ill frequently become packed with women absorbed in the case; and near-by houses periodically send representatives over to find out about the most recent developments.

Medicine counselling chants are performed by specialists before the medicines are turned over to the patient [Page 257] or the women attending him. 32 In this connection, it is important to note that counselling chants contain information for the medicines, not the patient, and for this reason they are addressed directly to the medicines. It should also be pointed out that the performance of these chants is the only absolutely necessary action of the medical specialist in the curing process. The medicines themselves are often prepared by the specialist’s wife or his students, although the specialist provides instructions on how this should be done. And once the medicines have been counselled, they are frequently taken to the patient’s home by someone other than the specialist himself.
32 It is not important that the person who ultimately counsels the medicines is the one who has collected them. Many specialists have a covey of students who are on their way to becoming adept botanists, and they are frequently sent into the jungle with a list of plants to collect. When this is done, responsible medicine men inspect the medicines to make sure the selection has been made correctly before they counsel them. The medicines are gathered, prepared, counselled by a medical specialist, and then taken to the patient. Only the most insignificant medicines may be used without the intervention of a specialists at some point in the process.
Beverages are also used as medicine for throat ailments. Many curing specialists are afflicted with throats which have ‘dried up’ ( tinkusa) because of constant chanting and inhaling the smoke of noxious plants such as chile peppers. In fact, most older specialists have difficulty making their way through longer chants without pausing frequently to cough up phlegm and taking a few swallows of throat medicine, which they keep in small pots at their side.

All medicinal treatments for serious illnesses or for the purpose of investing patients with powerful positive qualities are undertaken in seclusion and according to rigid regimen. Persons afflicted with severe infections, corrosive skin diseases, and ailments caused by ‘demons’ ( niakana) are kept tightly guarded in the homes of specialists, in their own homes, or in huts erected at some distance from the village. Visitors are discouraged and are sometimes restrained entirely from [Page 284] entering. 53 This rarely poses a problem, however, for knowledge of the virulent nature of the attacking poni is generally sufficient to keep would-be intruders away.
53 This makes things difficult for nosy ethnographers intent upon investigating cases of this sort. Once when I attempted to find out more about a girl who had been attacked by nia, I was effectively barred from the house. Although I knew the family of the patient well, several old women met me at the door and made it very clear, in a friendly yet insistent manner, that I was not welcome. This behavior is generally not the case with less severe illnesses.

The victim of a poisonous snake-bite should sit down immediately, remain as immobile as possible, and call for aid. As soon as helpers arrive, they bathe themselves to lower their nika level, for strong nika is dangerous to the victim’s weakened purpa. If some knowledge of medicines is present among those who have come to aid the victim, medicines are gathered and preliminary treatment is given. A specialist in snake medicine is sent for, and it is he who determines the seriousness of the bite. The victim is then carried carefully to a canoe in which medicines are placed. If the wound is minor, it is generally treated on the spot, and the victim is taken to his home, where treatment will continue. However, most victims [Page 288] of snake-bite are transported to a small thatched hut located some distance from the community, either on a nearby uninhabited island or on the mainland. 60 This is usually done in the late afternoon, when activities in the community have quieted down.
60 The Ustuppu snake-bite hut, which is mentioned by Nordenshiold (1938: 397), is no longer a permanent structure. When needed, it is hastily constructed. However, virtually all victims of snake-bite are now taken directly to the Ailikanti hospital.
At this point, a medicine man skilled in the treatment of snake-bite takes full charge of the case. The only people allowed near the hut are the assistants of the medicine man and older members of the patient’s family. Young people are excluded from the proceedings, for their nika is too strong and will cause harm to the patient; and pregnant women are strictly prohibited, for their bloated purpakana may attack and cause the victim’s purpa to swell. As soon as possible, the patient’s family presents the principal specialist with a string of multi-colored glass beads, which he places around his neck for the ceremony to follow (Figure 20); this gift is accompanied by a small number of sewing needles and fish hooks. If the specialist does not receive these items, he himself will be vulnerable to attack by snake ponikana (Nordenskiold 1938:397-8). 61
61 The necklace is perceived as similar to the patterned designs on the skin of a snake; the needles and fish hooks represent the snake’s fangs. The multi-colored bead necklaces are frequently worn by snake medicine men even when they are not working on a case, and serve as identity badges.
The principal snake-bite medicine man from the island was away on a trip at the time, so the case was handed over to another man, the chief of Sasarti, who knew a good deal less about snake medicine. The victim was not taken to a snake-bite hut on the mainland, but brought to the specialist’s house in Sasarti. The island was sealed off completely. A red flag was hoisted as a warning to approaching canoes that they should not beach on the island, and no villagers were allowed to visit the mainland. 70 All noise was prohibited. Sherzer was informed that he could play his tape recordings softly in the morning, but in the evening even this had to be stopped. A ring of guards was posted around the site of the ceremony, and another surrounded the entire neighborhood. While the treatment was [Page 295] in effect, there was some dissatisfaction over the measures being taken by the specialist in charge, and a number of special gatherings were called in Mulatuppu. These gatherings were short, directly to the point, and conducted in whispers so as not to endanger the patient. The fears of the village leaders were later substantiated when the patient came down with gangrene. The illness was clearly too much for the specialist’s limited abilities, and the patient was taken to the hospital at Ailikanti, where he was eventually cured.

At one end of the birth house, hammocks are tied from beams so as to face two small “birth enclosures” which are walled off from sight by pieces of cloth and leaves (Figure 29). The expectant mother is then positioned in the hammock at the center. She is flanked on either side by the principal midwife and her assistants, as well as by elderly women from the patient’s family. All of the women present have passed the age of childbearing, and the patient’s mother is usually not present. 16 It is important to note that the patient is directly attended to exclusively by women; men who involve themselves in the proceedings remain peripheral to the central core of action. Medicine men, who periodically bring medicines, leave them with the midwives to administer to the patient. A nele might be called in to confer with the midwives and offer his diagnosis. To do this, he interprets signs the midwives have observed in the behavior or physical condition of the pregnant woman, peers into the world of spirit, or, as is usually the case, weighs both sets of evidence. The third male specialist is the chanter of Muu Ikar (‘The Way of Muu’), who [Page 401] will perform only if birth is delayed and his intervention is deemed necessary by the shaman and the midwives. Under normal circumstances, none of these male specialists touches the patient or manipulates her physically in any way. 17 Medicine men are involved in counselling the spirits of the medicines they bring, and the nele is concerned with symptoms on the spiritual level. The chanter of Muu Ikar enters into a dialogue with his spirit helpers who will attempt to rescue the spirit of the fetus, should this is necessary. ...
The purpose of Muu Ikar is to assemble a host of shaman spirits and direct them on a journey to Muu’s house, where they will liberate the spirit of the fetus and return it to the birth house. This chant, like those discussed in preceding chapters, is a “script” in which the events described are understood to occur in the world of spirit as the words come out of the chanter’s mouth. If the specialist is skillfull and is able to demonstrate that he knows the spirits he is dealing with thoroughly, the actors in the drama -- protagonists and antagonists alike -- will be forced to follow the script. In this way, order is restored to the world of spirit, and the road [Page 407] is cleared for childbirth. On the other hand, if birth does not take place as expected, and there is no indication that the mother’s condition is improving, a new diagnosis is made and the chant repeated. The second chant may be modified in content, length, and emphasis according to the new diagnosis. ...
The older women of the house are in anguish, they are sobbing. They decide to solicit the assistance of the Muu Ikar specialist, and the mother of the pregnant woman sets out to find him. She arrives at his house, and after a short exchange he agrees to take the case, observing at the same time that ‘only my shamans, my spirits know (if we will succeed).’ He bathes, changes his clothes, and walks through the streets with his silver walking stick to the woman’s house.
The specialist approaches the woman’s hammock, positions himself on a golden stool, and begins to chant. Simultaneously, he drops chile peppers into the clay brazier at his feet and smoke rises in the air. The woman is agonizing, she is looking along Muu’s road, she is calling out in pain. In Muu’s house, ‘the angry ones have placed a bead necklace around her [Page 410] neck.’ 21 Muu’s cloths continue shutting around the woman, trapping her.

After these came ten great Neles, one of whom was a woman, who had great powers over the elements, knew many medicines, and who made many journeys to the underworld and heaven; reporting to the people what they had seen, upon their return. The exploits of these mythical heroes grade into accounts of chiefs and heroes who led the Cuna in wars with the Spanish, and guided the San Blas Cuna down from the mountains and out onto the islands. Neles and other specialists in the supernatural often have interpretations somewhat different from those held by the laity. There is a series of creation myths in which a culture hero Ibelele is credited with the origin of many things, and as with myths connected with Ibeorkun and his teachings, they are used as sanction for proper behavior in the ‘singing’ meetings. Actually, most specialists consider Ibelele, not as the creator of these things, but only the discoverer of what God created. These myths may be used in social control, for parts of them can be found to fit any situation. The teachings of these culture heroes seem as important as fear of punishment by God, either through the agency of evil spirits while here on earth, or in after worlds, as sanctions for proper behavior.’ Many of these myths teach much of the best in Christianity, and Nordenskiöld feels that these concepts came from Huguenots or Catholic missionaries. Though admitting a certain amount of [Page 217b] stimulus diffusion, the author fails to see much which is not inculcated as ideal behavior in many societies; though perhaps not as explicitly as in Cuna lore.”

During the day specialists gather medicinal plants in the mainland jungle and render the medicine effective by performing incantations to it. Chants are performed regularly as part of the curing process and for a variety of magical purposes. ... 
While there are structure and unity, both official and unofficial, at the level of the Kuna as an ethnic group, the most intense, active, day-to-day organization is at the level of the village. Politically, each village has its own organization consisting of ‘chiefs’ and other officials. In addition, each village has other ritual leaders—specialists in medicine, curing, magic, and puberty rites. Ideally each village is politically and ritually complete, each possible Kuna role being filled. But, while this ideal is met and by necessity must be met in the political organization (see chapters 2 and 3), this is not so with regard to other ritual roles. Some roles have more than one occupant in a particular village; others have none at all. Once again, village size is an important factor. The larger a village is, the more specialists one is likely to find living in it. This means that inhabitants of smaller villages might find it necessary to go outside the village for the curing of particular diseases or the performance of particular rituals—expensive and time-consuming operations.

After a disease has been diagnosed by a ‘seer,’ the cure is achieved by means of medicine gathered and prepared by an inatulet (medicinal specialist) and the performance of the appropriate curing ikar (way, text) by an ikar wisit ( ikar knower). The ‘medicinal specialist’ is an expert in the pharmaceutical properties of local plants and animals. At the behest of clients—patients or patients’ families—he searches for and prepares medicine. But this is not sufficient in itself. For the medicine to be potent and effective, it must be advised and given life. This is achieved by means of chants called ina uanaet (medicine counsel) which are directed to the medicine and the spirits of the medicine by the ‘medicinal specialist.’ Thus the task of the ‘medicinal specialist’ is twofold: in part to be knowledgeable about local medicine, in part to know the chant appropriate to each type of medicine.

The three Kuna ritual traditions, while independent of one another, can also be in conflict. There are ‘medicinal specialists’ who do not attend meetings in the ‘gathering house’ and who publicly affirm their disinterest in its tradition. Their prestige and influence emerge from their own domain. On the other hand, ‘chiefs’ and other political leaders are critical of individuals who do not participate in ‘gatherings’ and sometimes try to force their participation. A concrete example of the competition between the ‘gathering’ and curing traditions is the habit of certain ‘ ikar knowers’ to practice, booming out their texts for all to hear, in a house near the ‘gathering house’ on evenings when men’s talking meetings are held there.
Each curing and magical ikar exists in different versions. Ideally all are equally effective. But in practice some ‘ ikar knowers’ have reputations for knowing an ikar better or for knowing more effective versions. When a teacher and students of the same ikar live in the same village, they are ranked, with the teacher being ranked highest. Teachers and students often criticize each other. Students claim that their teacher will not let them finish learning an ikar or that he will not admit that they have learned it. Teachers argue that their students have not completely mastered the ikar. This is no doubt one of [Page 69] the major reasons why it is common practice to learn an ikar from a renowned teacher from a distant village: In this way both teacher and student gain prestige and at the same time avoid subsequent conflict. Also, certain ‘knowers’ learn their ikarkana in dreams from spirits or deceased specialists. While these ‘knowers’ have patients and students, there is antagonism toward them on the part of those ‘knowers’ who have learned in the more ordinary way, with a live, human teacher, especially if they claim to be specialists in the same ikar.
Since Kuna ritual roles involve the learning of long and often difficult verbal traditions, it is relatively older men who achieve positions of leadership. Furthermore, certain verbal traditions, especially the most prestigious, are in practice restricted to older men. Younger men must apprentice themselves to older leaders, specialists, and teachers and wait their turn—this causes considerable frustration on the part of the younger men. Because of this social and political situation, coupled with economic pressures, Kuna men are leaving their villages in increasing numbers and staying away longer than in the past. The unfortunate result is that San Blas villages are losing some of their most intelligent young men, who prefer cooking and washing dishes in Panama City to the economic and social frustrations of San Blas.

Varying approaches to curing can cause differences of opinion. A particularly good example has to do with snakebite. This is a very sensitive area in that the Kuna are agriculturalists and the jungle mainland is populated by a number of very dangerous snakes. There are curing specialists who believe that in the treatment of snakebites, because evil spirits abound, the entire village must be involved. In extreme cases this might mean the prohibition of work in the jungle and the prohibition of noise in the village, especially at night. Radios are silenced, people are told to walk barefoot, and ‘gatherings’ are either canceled or held in a whisper; no chanting is permitted. Other specialists, however, disagree. They hold that if a curing specialist is adequately trained, if he is truly an expert, he should be able to cure a snakebite victim rapidly without the need to disrupt village life—medicine, ikarkana, and ‘secrets’ should suffice.
These differences can lead to conflict, especially when the principal exponents of the different approaches live in the same village.

‘Medicinal specialists,’ ‘ ikar knowers,’ and kanturkana learn their professions through years of study with well-known, respected specialists from their own and especially from other, often distant villages. The student lives with the teacher and helps him with various activities, from farming to gathering medicine. As they work together, they talk about various types of medicine, how and where to find them, and what their function is. An important aspect of the acquisition of curing techniques is the learning of the names of the different medicines and the diseases or problems they are used for.
The teaching of magical ikarkana involves a focus on memorization of a fixed text, which must be learned completely and exactly. An ‘ ikar knower’ or a kantule knows his text perfectly and can repeat it identically when performing it in the context of its magical function or when teaching it to others. In teaching sessions, the specialist performs a section of the ikar and the student repeats it, the teacher correcting him when he makes a mistake or cannot think of the next line. Ikar learning involves considerable effort—long ikarkana, such as ‘the way of the mass curer’ or ‘the way of the kantule,’ require many years of study. Learning is made particularly difficult by the fact that the verbal text must first be perfectly memorized before the teacher explains the meanings of the words and the symbolism. The students of the ‘mass curer’ and the kantule have official roles in the rituals themselves, including performing ikarkana along with the teacher. In this way, the students gain recognition for [Page 226] their efforts, learn their texts through actual practice, and are socialized into their ritual role.
Another way in which an ikar can be learned is in dreams, in which case the teacher is either a representative of the spirit world who knows the ikar or a deceased person who knew the ikar when she or he was alive. The ikar is learned in a series of dreamed sessions. It is especially ‘seers,’ who have supernatural mental ability, who can learn ikarkana in dreams. But others can study this way too. Sometimes, individuals who desire to learn ikarkana in dreams take special medicine. While the medicine might work, it can also produce undesirable effects; in particular, it can result in the person’s unwittingly causing sickness and even death to others. Individuals who have learned ikarkana in dreams are accepted as specialists by the community in varying degrees. Their ability is verified through public performance, and they also acquire students. At the same time, they are open to criticism from specialists who have learned their ikarkana from live teachers through hard, tedious work and some form of payment. Such individuals are prone to voice skepticism about others who claim to have learned by another, less overt, and obviously less verifiable process. ...
As a result of this interplay between official and unofficial knowledge, the actual relationship between knowers and understanders of tradition tends to lie along a continuum rather than be a dichotomy between specialists and nonspecialists, as the official version would have it. This makes it possible for ritual language and tradition to be both secretive and nonsecretive, esoteric and nonesoteric, at the same time. Specialists gain prestige for their knowledge and performance, but nonspecialists are not totally frozen out. Performances can be appreciated by many individuals to varying degrees, and participation in ritual events is encouraged. Kuna ritual leaders constantly profess a desire to transmit their knowledge to individuals eager to learn. They complain that nowadays people are no longer interested. The learning of ritual knowledge is open to everyone—anyone who is willing has the right to study and eventually to become a specialist. 7 As a result, most people have at least a little understanding of ritual matters.

Curers and doctors differ most obviously in that doctors are ladinos and curers tend to be Indians (although ladino curers are known). In addition, they deal with illnesses in sufficiently contrastive ways so that two role identifying labels must be maintained. They are both recognized to be able to reduce illness (as a basis for further inference and action) by prescribing medicines that can be purchased in the pharmacy. These may be taken orally, injected, or applied as a salve. The doctor further prescribes and may himself perform some minor surgery, X-ray examinations, and other traditional Western-European [Page 123] strategies for diagnosing and reducing illness. The curer does not engage in surgery, nor does he prescribe any of the more complex testing procedures whose results he does not imagine himself to be able to interpret. Instead, he recommends additional substances he purchased from the pharmacy such as tallow, wines, herbs in aguardientes as well as substances which are sometimes found in domesticated state, and more often found wild in the general vicinity of Aguacatenango. These include some kinds of flowers, bark, leaves, roots, stems, flesh of animals and fishes, animal waste products, eggs and so on. These substances are variously taken orally, applied externally, or inhaled as steam. Unlike doctors, curers practice bleeding and cupping; they also administer some medications in the form of steam while the patient is seated on a platform over a fire. They incorporate adornment of the sick-bed into curing ritual. The ritual may also include prayer. Most important, perhaps, the curers undertake to examine the recent life history of the individual who is ill, in terms of the possibility that the individual has encountered some disease producing entity which can explain, in his particular case, the onset of the disease process. There is no illness for which the curer does not have an explanation together with a set of strategies for dealing with it. At present, at least one curer, when confronted with very serious cases, will refer his patient to a doctor, but this does [Page 124] not yet appear to be a popular alternative. Generally, the doctor is the last of all medical practitioners referred to in exhausting the curing options in Aguacatenango, though individuals who have had a successful relationship with the doctor are more likely to pursue that option sooner. The only other major class of medical practitioners is the talking saint. Talking saints are more or less representational images of saints who, in conjunction with their “owners” can actively consult with human beings about their trials and tribulations in the world. The most powerful of this class, San Miguel of Soyaló, is about an eight hour trip and a 200 peso fee from Aguacatenango. Talking saints share more features with the curers than they do with doctors. They, like the curers, are predestined by God to their role, but they more directly represent God's omniscience. The cure of the talking sai it is more powerful as can be measured by the greater expenditure of funds for such a cure, or as can be measured by his greater ability to divine in the life history of the patient the principal sources of illness.

The herb doctors, while really not considered shamans, are noted for their vast knowledge of the curative properties of herbs. Generally, these men cure without music, drinking, or remuneration. They are druggists, comparatively speaking, and furnish medicine to the Indians. However, some attain fame and gain a livelihood through their practice. This was especially true of Jesús, a doctor in Guadalupe pueblo. He was exceptional in having the rank of a full-time practitioner. The more Mexicanized of these doctors may know and use simple store medicines. A maggot-extracting doctor would not use a store medicine even if he knew about it. ...
In a sense, the Tarahumaras do not formally recognize this classification. The name oorúgame applies to all shamans, with the possible exception of herb doctors and chanters, although Lumholtz insists the chanters are classed as shamans. Differences in qualifications, however, are clearly recognized by the Indians themselves. They know that there are doctors who may use peyote and others who may not. They recognize the fact that some shamans can extract maggots, and they honor them accordingly. The chanters are easily distinguished. If one wishes to have the dutubúri sung and danced, the chanter must be invited. The Indian may invite a regular shaman as well for some other part of the fiesta . The chanters are given the name of sawéame, meaning “he who uses the rattle [ sawáka ].” ...
The following short list shows the past and present shamans of Samachique and some of their specialties. [maggot extractor]

The Tarahumaras have not advanced very far in the art of medicine in spite of a great amount and variety of curing. Most of the cures are simple and require no special ability outside of ritual. The herb specialists, however, have some real empirical basis of knowledge. But even in their case the truly beneficial and the superstitious are inextricably entwined. My informant, Jesús, would speak with scorn of the hoax involved in the extraction of maggots but would highly recommend the carrying of a cane of cocolmeca as a cure for rheumatism in the arm. ... Medicinal cures have been maintained for a slightly different reason. Their use involves little of either significance or ritual. One learns them much as he acquires the names for trees and plants. Specialists have also made a practice of preserving this herb knowledge. Relationship terms survive while native personal names have disappeared. Secret names involving a special significance tend to die out.

The owerúame is a most necessary ceremonial figure in both the bautizado and gentile communities, and each family has one to which it appeals for its curing needs. The status is basically an achieved status, even though according to Tarahumara theory, the power is born in one. It is evident that considerable training in “medicines” and ritual is necessary. There are many differences in popularity and reputation among the various holders of curing powers. Many people claim to hold such power in one form or another, but only a few enjoy wide reputations and are sought from great distances. Female curers exist, but are rare.
In the development of an owerúame’s career and prestige three major stages may be abstracted. The initial stage usually begins in youth for those who feel “called.” Because a major part of curing and divining is done in dreams, a requisite qualification is imagination and a propensity for dreaming. Generally, the owerúame dreams of the person’s soul being in some kind of danger and he rescues it, thereby effecting the cure. A boy who dreams a great deal and is very imaginative likely begins to think of himself as having curative powers and will be encouraged in this. Seledonio of Inápuchi began his career at about age 15 when he received a warning from an angel in a vision. It threatened disaster if the people did not dance and sacrifice a white bull and a white chicken.
In addition to a perception of being “called,” the neophyte must learn the details of the various rituals. These are fairly simple, and the youth reporting such visionary experience is often given a subordinate ritual role under the tutelage of an owerúame . He may act as leader and flag bearer of the troop of boys who parade through the young corn in the annual field-curing ceremony, or he may assist in lightning prevention rituals.
In the second stage of his career the owerúame begins to perform some rituals alone, and sometimes receives invitations to cure the sick at nearby ranchos . When his supernatural activities become known in the immediate vicinity, his career development [Page 133] then depends upon opportunity, his sense of drama, manipulative skill, and success in those rituals he is called upon to perform. His opportunity comes sooner or later, since not only do the older practitioners eventually die, but often they must make long journeys to distant ranchos, and, therefore, are not available for emergencies in their own territory. On some occasions a small curing ceremony may not require a great owerúame, and this allows the neophyte (or owéame ) a chance to practice his ritual skills.

Calistro began recovering almost as soon as the bakánawi specialist finished, but over the summer he relapsed. By mid-August he could not walk without pain, had no appetite, and had lost a lot of weight. His in-laws tried to convince him to enter the Jesuit-run clinic in Creel, about fifty kilometers away, but Calistro was afraid he would die there. He finally agreed to go if the clinic staff could cure an old Rarámuri man from Rejogochi whom they were treating. The old man died in the clinic a few days later.

People in Rejogochi also occasionally use commercial drugs they buy from Chabochis. They consider these medicines to be particularly appropriate for curing the personified illnesses known as nawirí (most of which they consider to be minor) because both the nawirí and the medicines come from the Devil. They also recognize the competence of Chabochi doctors, both folk practitioners and licensed M.D.s, in treating minor ailments and injuries. The residents of Rejogochi frequently carry their babies to several local Mestizo women to have the babies’ fontanelles lifted, stating that these women are more adept at this procedure than are their Rarámuri counterparts. 43 They also take advantage of the medical services offered at nearby clinics and hospitals operated by the Jesuit missionaries and the Mexican government (Anzures y Bola[unknown]nos 1978). However, the Rarámuri maintain that Chabochi doctors cannot cure illnesses caused by soul loss or sorcery and thus see no point in calling upon them for those illnesses, except perhaps as a last resort.

Prior to the construction of the nursing station in 1972, childbirth took place either at the mother's home or at a hunting camp, with assistance provided by older and more knowledgeable women. Today the vast majority of women prefer to give birth at the nursing station rather than remain in Yellowknife for two to three weeks prior to the birth of the child. Generally, only women pregnant with their first child or those with a history of birth complications are encouraged to fly to Yellowknife where better obstetrical and neonatal care is available.

In addition to leadership roles in political affairs, women held other specialized status positions in Ojibway history. Among the medico-religious specialists, medicine women played a prominent role. They not only treated illness in general but served the special medical needs of other women, particularly at childbirth. Medicine women were not just midwives, as most adult women knew how to assist in labor. They were called in when complications arose and were paid for their services as specialists. Medicine women were also consulted by women who wished to induce abortion or prevent a miscarriage. In the latter case, one medicine woman mixed certain herbs with lint and had her patient stand over the smoldering mixture. Knowledge of this cure came “to my sister and me from my mother, and she received it from her grandmother…; Since no one but my sister and I have this knowledge, and we won't live much longer, it will die when we go; it belongs to our family.”

There have always been occasional men and women who were single all their lives. They are simply called bachelors, with no judgments involved. The women, as they lived alone and had to support themselves, necessarily undertook such masculine activities as trapping, canoe-making, even hunting. The skilled ones were generally respected. One of the men, John Wilson's mother's brother, said he did not marry because he did not like women. No sex abnormalities were known of these people; indeed, the Emo people could not understand the description of the berdache.

There are four kinds of doctoring obtained in dreams. Two command great prestige: nanan'dawiwiwe'.w[unavailable]n[unavailable]n[unavailable] (doctor man), and the tc[unknown]isak`i (diviner). The two which command lesser prestige are the blood-letters: patc`icka[unknown]owe' or, patc`icka'ige (one who employs a pointed instrument), and the pa'sk ikwe'.ige (one who lets blood). 2
2 The white physician is called “herbal man” because there is a native practitioner of the same title, who, like the white, practises by right of purchased knowledge and makes a great use of herbal etc. prescriptions. The term is mack[unavailable]ki[unknown] w[unavailable]n[unavailable]ni (herbs, or drugs, man), or mack[unavailable]ki[unknown]ige (herbs worker).

The third specialty is mack[unavailable]kiwabo.ke, herb-brewing. This covers all the Ojibwa drug realm not covered by the above two specialties. The drugs brewed are very considerable in number; some are rare, and are imported at great price from other aboriginal localities. They are used to treat nearly every disorder, some of which are nose-bleed (which we have seen to be treated as well by the nanandawi' iwe), sex diseases, diarrhoea, lung bleeding, menstrual disturbances, womb troubles, constipation, etc. In some cases, treatment is realistic, in others the guardian spirit is invoked. The invocation is not necessary, and depends on individual temperament or on a special supernatural experience. But the knowledge of the prescriptions is always purchased, except between close relatives, and between the practitioner and his assistant. (In every realm, assistants acquire property by their services, no other payments being required.) Everyone knows some prescriptions. The more prominent herbalists at Manitou are: (men) the brothers Namepok, Kebegaba u, Kekekobin[unknown]s; their brother's son Dan Hawk; Sandy Horton; Billy M'Ginnis and his father's father, Chief Jack; Jack M'Ginnis 2nd; (women) Mrs. Bunyan, her daughter Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Chief George and her daughter Mrs. Jack M'Ginnis 2nd, Mrs. Charlie Speaker.

Women are the midwives of the Ojibwa. Men are excluded from a childbirth except for a certain brief magical performance which is resorted to in a desperate case. Midwifery is a highly skilled occupation, depending upon an extensive herbal knowledge, detailed knowledge of the female anatomy and physiology, varied massage techniques, and a cool and resourceful intelligence. This profession, too, is not open to all women but only to those who show marked aptitude and interest. Public recognition of a woman's ability is expressed by repeated requests for her services at confinements.

In the training of a girl, the lesser avoidance relatives are most important in developing her unconventionality, for they employ her as an assistant in their work. A girl who accompanies her father on a duck or moose hunt must learn all the cautions of the hunt except the actual shooting. Personal inclinations may then tip the scales [Page 137] of sex difference. ... If a man's only child is a daughter, it is almost a certainty that he will teach her the work of a man, at the same time that her mother will teach her the work of a woman. This was the case with Iron Woman, the daughter of a famous shaman. She was noted for her “supernatural” ability at all skilled activities: religious performances, games, hunting. Her father had taught her carefully, and had provoked her to prove her superiority over others. She was so interested she never thought of marrying and maintaining her own lodge; besides “she thought no man was good enough for her.” Her parents did not coax her to marry; they were interested chiefly in making her their companion in all that they knew and did.
Iron Woman practised as a shaman and, like a man was the victim of her own profession. (Continued sorcery acts like a boomerang upon the practitioner: after it has been sent out and has accomplished its mission, it returns to the home of its owner, and lying there as idle mischief, it causes the death of near relatives, usually young children). “She never cried in front of people when her children died, but she used to go back in the bush and cry. One time an old woman heard her crying and talking. ‘Oh, manito, what can I do to undo all the bad things I did when I was young, so that my children will be able to live?’ When she came back she gave her father a slap and said, ‘Yes, it is all your fault that I am in misery. You made me use all this medicine, you old devil!’ Her father did not answer her. But later he said, ‘Yes, my daughter, it is true that you will always suffer for that. That is why I always advised you never to marry. I will give you some medicine so that you will never have children again.’ And she said, ‘No, I'm going to have another child soon.’ They did everything in their power so that the child would live. She even went through the Grand Medicine ceremony for her unborn child. When her baby was born, they put it through the [Page 154] ceremony also, but it lived just a short time, and then it too died. Iron Woman had almost died when she was giving birth to the child, and her parents gave her medicine so that she would never have a child again. But she did not know this. After her baby died, she said that she did not want any more medicine (shamanistic ability), and she let go even her sucking doctor practise and her gambling. About three years later, when she did not have another child, she was angry. She knew that her father must have given her medicine to drink, and she gave him a good scolding. But after she let everything (shamanistic) go, she became a coward. She never went anywhere alone in the dark, or even in the daytime. Her husband always had to go with her, for she was so afraid. One night when her husband was out walking and she was alone, a woman came in and started to wrestle with her. She did not know who it was, and she was very frightened. The woman said, ‘You made a darn fool of me, and I'm here to square up with you.’ She could not get hold of this woman for it was the ghost of a woman from whose bones her father had scraped medicine. Of course she did not know it was a ghost. When her husband came in, the ghost disappeared. And she was afraid to stay alone. Some time after that when her husband was out, a man came in and started to wrestle with her as the woman had done. After that she used to faint as soon as they came in.” The deliberate abandonment of her established special lifeways, and the obsessive fears and remorse that preyed upon her resulted in a temporary breakdown during which she sent her husband away and wandered about in the woods waiting for death.

Gathering and selling snakeroot illustrates how the Anishinaabeg learned to integrate their traditional seasonal pursuits into the market economy. Herbal specialists among the Anishinaabeg had long recognized the medicinal properties of Seneca snakeroot ( Polygala senega L.), calling it bi'jikiwuck or “cattle medicine.” They made a decoction from it for coughs, colds, convulsions, and in combination with other plants for heart trouble, treated sore throats with an infusion from its leaves, [Page 81] and used it to destroy swallowed water bugs. American pharmacists also came to value snakeroot primarily as an expectorant and cough remedy, creating a market for it. Local merchants, like Sylem Fairbanks, advertised “Market Prices paid for Ginseng, Snake Root and Furs.” Indians obliged, gathering far more than they needed for their own medicinal needs. Wagoosh, a young man who was courting John Rogers's sister, introduced him to snakeroot, telling him that “the prices… are going to be high.” Once Rogers learned the technique of digging roots, there was no stopping him. Soon he and his brother “were bragging over our speed in pulling the snake root” and making it a “contest to see who would get the biggest root for his sack.” Wagoosh also taught Rogers's family how to market snakeroot by escorting his mother to town to exchange it for a “goodly supply of groceries.” After that, he and his family “dug snake root every day, making several trips to town with it—so we always had a good supply of edibles.” Snakeroot had become a significant source of income, and the Anishinaabeg learned how to get the best price for it. Some observers regarded collecting snakeroot and ginseng ( Panax quinquefolius L.) as a demeaning way to make a living. For the Anishinaabeg, however, it provided yet another source of income that was easily integrated into the seasonal round.

The origins of the Midewiwin ceremony have long been debated by scholars: some maintain that it was a post-contact development in Ojibwa culture, stimulated by certain features of European belief and organization. Aboriginal people maintain that it is much older than this, however, and recent re-assessment of the post-contact origin argument tends to support the Aboriginal view. 84 Certainly, by the late eighteenth century the ceremony was well established and played an important role in Ojibwa culture. The Midewiwin has been described by its practitioners as a life-giving ceremony: it was performed to cure serious illnesses, and its teachings helped the people to live properly so as to obtain success and health in life and to prepare for the afterlife. The Midewiwin ceremony included the retelling of Ojibwa history and origin stories, which contained lessons on the “right” [Page 24] way to live. Men and women who were initiated into the Midewiwin regarded themselves as relatives even if they came from different clans, families, and areas, and because of this the Midewiwin reinforced social ties among these groups and spread a common body of traditions to people who were usually isolated from each other.

These patterns of interaction reveal a relationship between the Ojibwa and the clergy that involved far more than simple manipulation. Communication within this relationship was always obscured by cross-cultural “static.” Each side, quite understandably, interpreted the other from within its own cultural framework, and there was an astounding lack of “fit” between the two cultural systems. The Ojibwa, for instance, likened the missionaries to their own religious specialists — shamans — and expected them to perform the same functions, including curing and the use of spiritual power to lend physical protection to vulnerable humans. They were thus disillusioned by the deaths of children sent to an early missionary school in Red River. The missionary was told that the Natives “think it is of no use to send you their children as you can no more keep them from dying than they can themselves.”

There are only a few recognized “specialists” practicing blood-letting by the cupping method at the present time. The practitioners are usually women (bepe'šwe'jikwe, cutting or scratching woman), and there is no cult or supernatural practices connected with it. The knowledge and technique is taught to an apprentice for a fee, although one male informant claimed he was taught how to do it by a mosquito and horse-fly, through a dream. The patient pays the doctor a fee, usually tobacco and some common article, but one person charges a fee of $5.00 per treatment. The most common ailments treated in this manner are headaches and blood-poisoning, but such things as dizziness, soreness, swelling, and rheumatism are also regarded as curable by this technique.
The equipment consists of a sharp instrument for making the incision, and a section of horn to draw off the blood (Fig. 5). In several instances the lancet was obtained by smashing a coldcream jar and selecting a sharp fragment, but a knife or razor may be used, and one practitioner had a triangular steel blade set into a wooden handle. The cupper is made from a three- or four-inch section of the small end of a cow horn which is cleaned out and the tip perforated. To cure a headache, for example, the doctor makes a slanting incision in the temple of the patient so as to strike a vein, puts the large end of the horn over the cut, and sucks on the small end to draw off the blood which is caught in a dish. According to one informant the blood is caught in a dish containing water and emptied outside in an isolated spot “where no-one will step on it or disturb it.” Blood-letting is limited to the head and limbs, and for blood-poisoning the person is bled until “all the dark blood is out and the blood runs red and clear.” A pint seems to be about the maximum removed at any one time. No sterilization of the lancet is reported, but some doctors apply a native salve to the cut after the bleeding has stopped, or a native astringent may be used to stop the bleeding. When a metal lancet is used the point is placed over a vein [Page 194] and lightly snapped with the thumb and finger to make the cut. In some cases two or three treatments over a period of several weeks are necessary before a cure is effected. While blood-letting was not scientifically employed by the Chippewa, it undoubtedly effected cures in some instances. That blood-letting can have a salutary physiological effect is indicated by the fact that modern medical science makes considerable use of it in cases of hypertension and Polycythemia Vera. ...
Another technique for curing the same ailments as by cupping is to strike repeatedly the ailing area of the patient with an instrument set with a series of needles. This method is practiced by individual specialists, mostly women, who work without supernatural assistance. The usual fee is a gift of tobacco often accompanied by such articles as blankets or beadwork. The tattooing instrument in former times was usually the upper or lower jaw of a garfish, of which the long rows of needle-like teeth served quite well. I obtained one such specimen in 1941, but it was the only one on the reservation to my knowledge (Fig. 6). The usual type today is a series of steel needles set into the end of a stick. The instrument is first dipped into a native medicine and the sore spot hammered on, and sometimes a poultice or medicine is applied afterward. Medicine is always used in conjunction with tattooing.

Bloodletting, now rarely practiced, was a traditional form of medical treatment among the Lake Winnipeg Saulteaux. It must be regarded as a strictly practical form of medicine; it was not associated with drumming, incantations, or other ritual activities. It involved specialists not necessarily associated with the Grand Medicine Society and there is evidence at Little Black River that the art was transmitted from father to son. A substantial knowledge of the circulatory system was required, and over 200 physiological terms were collected in 1965 (Steinbring 1965a).

The Wabenos appealed to traditional manitos and recalled the aboriginal myths. Their ceremonies used dance and song as means of religious communication, but the rituals themselves were innovations. Visionaries played prominent roles in the founding of the movement and thus continued an essential aspect of the traditional religion, as did their concern for hunting and curing (Jenness 1935: 62–63). Their leaders, however, vied with the older specialists. And when hunting did not increase, the movement vanished, leaving unassociated Wabenos in undefined positions, serving no apparent religious function and falling increasingly under the accusations of witchcraft. As a movement the Wabeno complex lasted no longer than the early twentieth century.

Indian surgeons were apparently as successful with fractures and dislocations. However, Lafitau's assertion that they did not perform less well with ruptures and hernias and that broken bones mended in 8 days' times is questionable. The important fact historically is that [Page 513] these early medicine men undertook the same types of cures that are also attributed to their descendants, the present holders of the Little Water Medicine bundles. As specialists the latter profess some feats that were formerly performed quite commonly by hunters, among whom dislocations were more frequent than fractures.
If an Indian has dislocated his foot or knee, when hunting alone, he creeps to the next tree, and tying one end of his strap to it, fastens the other to the dislocated limb, and lying on his back, continues to pull it till it is reduced.

LAFITAU (IV. 79 ff.) presents an interesting essay on Indian medicine. It seems that there were two classes of practitioners, healing the one by art, and the other by science. The first class treated ailments by physical means, lotions, decoctions, steam-baths, etc. Many of their remedies were surprisingly efficacious, others operated rather by violence than by any special adaptation to the end. The herbs which they used were improved by being gathered at certain times and seasons, etc., and the general method of treating diseases was not unlike that of remote communities anywhere. Their surgery was clumsy, being performed only with flint instruments, and to the surprise of the French they used bleeding only for local congestions, not as the panacea it was in Europe. They could set broken bones, and in the cure of wounds were wonderfully successful. Lafitau describes the treatment, which consisted simply in keeping the wound clean and sheltering it from the air. The effects of this therapy seemed marvellous to Europeans.

When a somewhat more complicated disease develops, one has recourse to the known herbal specialists. These specialists--the stereotype depicts an “old woman,” although they may be of either sex-have become known for their general skill or perhaps for success in treating special diseases. One was known to be a specialist for bladder obstruction; another for piles and skin diseases; still others for tuberculosis and appendicitis. In each case the doctor had been known to produce successful cures. ...
Medicine should be dispensed without charge to all those who have need of it and who ask for it. Obviously, this is not a satisfactory arrangement for the herbal specialists, and payment is now expected either in money or goods or by an exchange of herbs, although most of them affect a show of reluctance when payment is offered. When a medicine is given to a patient, the herbalist always includes instructions concerning its use, and in case of severe illness he may even supervise the treatment. ... The medicines used are mainly herbal preparations, sometimes prepared by specialists and sometimes simply prepared privately.
The boundary between the natural herbal preparations and the more magical ones is often indistinct. The more sophisticated herbal specialists say that their medicines contain ingredients which have great power and which can be procured only under special circumstances. An example is the remedy for “summer complaint” (intestinal flu) called onrahs?ago[unknown] wa (“large rooster comb”), which is a pine-tree fungus. This medicine “calls one with a clucking noise high from a pine tree,” and in order to be an effective agent it must be shot. Furthermore, it must be shot immediately, else it will “run and hide,” and, therefore, it is very scarce. After being shot, it is detached from the tree, dried, and given as a powder in a cup of water. This medicine seems to “holler” after having been administered, just as when it was found, for when the writer took a dose, all three people who knew about it independently heard it “holler” at night in the tree outside their house, although the tree was not a pine but a maple. Also, it is said to presage a death in the family by “hollering” in its storage container. Knowledge and use of this type of medicinal agent--seminaturalistic, semimagical--usually qualifies its dispenser to be called “a real doctor,” with the implication that the preparations are slightly tinged with the magical, but not as seriously as witch medicines or hunting-charm medicines. Since such medicines are dispensed rather secretly, and since a certain amount of esoteric knowledge is involved in their preparation, it is not difficult to see how suspicion of witchcraft might be attached to the herbalist. It is also not [Page 267] inconceivable that these herbalists do at times allow themselves to become implicated, perhaps unwittingly, in the preparation of witchcraft or counter-witchcraft. A basic maxim for the Iroquois might be: “whoever is close to Indian medicine is close to witchcraft.”

Yet another example [of adopting "white man's medicine"] is that of one of the most erudite of the practicing herbal specialists, who is always intensely interested in the descriptions and uses of “white medicine,” and in addition to buying and prescribing them outright, has used many of them as ingredients in her “traditional” mixtures. Another herbalist, who at the age of ninety was still the “spring tonic” specialist of the Reserve, was said to include “store” items in her preparation, whose composition she learned from “the old people.” Thus there is evidence that the incorporation of medicines and herbs procured in the neighboring pharmacies has a long history at Six Nations.

The only prerequisite for either a man or a woman to practice fortunetelling is the elusive one of being properly endowed by the Great Creator. A strong indication of this endowment, though by no means a necessary one, is to be born with a caul. Ideally, there are some disqualifications. Chiefs, preachers, and Longhouse speakers ought not engage in fortunetelling, but in the real culture this is ignored. It is not at all clear how the practicing fortunetellers become aware of their own powers, but it is unlikely that a normal member of the conservative community would practice without conviction, for there are strong warnings against such presumption. A reflection of these warnings is found in the Code (Parker, 1913: 49-50), which relates that when Handsome Lake was asked to divine on behalf of his halfniece, he protested that he had not yet been so empowered by the messengers. He was, however, persuaded to tell fortunes against his will and against the will of the Angels. At Six Nations it is said that “the people bossed him into fortunetelling, else they could not have feasts.” The warnings against unauthorized fortunetelling are reinforced by a general fear of improper contact with medicines and supernatural agencies, which are characterized as being “too dangerous to fool around with.” Although the ability to tell fortunes is considered to be a gift of the Creator, the details of the art are often supposed to be learned from older practitioners, and skill can be increased by “practicing” (in analogy to ritual speaking or singing). ...
The fortunetellers tend to prescribe standard cures for a few characteristic symptoms. Among these are False Face Dances for facial paralysis, Red False Face rites for nose bleeding, Otter rites for sore, red eyes, Bear Dance for hysterical spitting or clambering along the wall, formation of a ritual friendship for “lonely” children, snow-snake or ball games for sore legs, and Little Water Medicine for internal injuries and broken bones. However, the body of specific Indian cures for specific ailments is quite limited today, contrary to some of the reports in the literature (e.g., Speck, 1949: 59), and there is considerable latitude even within the standardized part of medical lore. Each consultation with a fortuneteller is a unique case, for not only is the method of diagnosis at the discretion of the fortuneteller, but he is free to vary the standard prescription because of the particular circumstances of the patient and his complaint. Thus fortunetelling is an individualistic activity which may be properly characterized as an art, and each practitioner has his own style.

Another factor to consider with respect to the continuance of traditional Iroquois medicine is the effect of Christianity. The fact that the Christian Iroquois in one Grand River settlement in 1798 did not actively participate in a Longhouse feast intended to ward off sickness, among other things, has already been noted. Adherence to Christianity, at least ideally, might eliminate recourse to medicine societies and other ceremonies connected with curing in the Longhouse, such as the forming of ritual friendships and the holding of curative feasts. The effects of Christianity upon the more pragmatic aspect of Iroquois medicine--herbal remedies--would appear to have been less immediate, as the use of plants believed to have medicinal properties, always less extensive than among the Longhouse Iroquois, was retained among Christian families until the early 1900's. The practice was probably retained because although certain beliefs and rituals accompanied the collection and administration of herbs by a specialist, these did not necessarily apply for the ordinary individual. Thus an individual could continue relying on or simply sporadically using herbs without necessarily having an ideological commitment to the Longhouse faith.

Almost all of the information on childbirth was obtained from a professional native midwife. She delivered [Page [p.501-a]] her first child when she was only 13 years old, following the instructions of her mother, and by 1954 (age 60) had successfully delivered over 40 babies. In the old days, the midwife and her assistants were supposed to be gUnEtkAna[unknown]yi—members of the opposite moiety, women either of the patient’s father’s sib or of her husband’s sib. Actually, any woman or girl would be expected to help in an emergency, and the most skilled would naturally be called. However, the women who were close relatives in the opposite moiety were supposed to do what they could to help the mother and the new baby.

On other occasions a powerful group might decide to remain in the community and the weaker victim group or individual might be unable to receive a just settlement. In this case the hostility fell outside the normal peace making structure that dealt mainly with interclan disputes. In intraclan situations hostilities, jealousy, or envy left unchecked might fester within the mind of an individual until revenge became the dominant motive in life. In such cases witchcraft provided an alternative course of action. Through witchcraft a person could seek mystical power to revenge another individual who had caused the first person to be hurt in some way in the past. A witch attempted to destroy social good will. The actions of the lier, thief, or the adulterer also posed a direct threat against group solidarity and their behavior was difficult to explain. The practitioner of witchcraft and the incestuous individual were both consigned as evil doers who were believed to be in league with evil powers or else such deeds would not have been perpetuated according to Native belief. Both elements lay beyond the normal political processes of the crest group. Therefore, an Indian doctor from another clan, who could not be blinded by the power of witchcraft from within the group, was called in to detect the witch and to force a cancellation of the spell. To resolve the conflict close relatives of the practitioner were expected to administer the punishment in order to absolve the community of the problem, to avoid retaliation, and restore the community to normalcy.

Faint-hearted lovers, or more aggressive ones whose advances were repulsed by the girls of their choice, sometimes employed love medicines to bring them success in their amorous endeavors. These were secret formulae concocted by specialists for a fee. Because the Cree Indians were famous for these medicines, the Blackfeet referred to love medicine as “Cree Medicine.” There were many varieties. One such medicine called for making two little birch bark images, one representing a man and the other a woman. A stick was dipped in the liquid medicine, then touched to the hearts of the male and female figures. This magic was certain to make the girl long for the company of her as yet unsuccessful lover. So powerful were love medicines reputed to be that resistance to them was considered useless.

Other owners called in a horse medicine man or a specialist in the treatment of broken bones. Bear-Goes-East, a Piegan of the Blood band, was remembered as a well-known specialist. He was credited with the power to heal broken bones of animals or humans, by rubbing them with mud. The horse owner paid him well, sometimes another [Page 50] horse, for his services. Bear-Goes-East was considered a powerful doctor, but not a horse medicine man. Lazy Boy recalled that once, while on a war party, Bear-Goes-East’s partner fell over a cliff and broke his leg. The Crow Indians were chasing them. Bear-Goes-East collected some mud from a nearby lake, applied it to his partner’s leg, and “healed it right there.”

In buffalo days if a horse suffered from an illness the owner was unable to diagnose, he might load a musket with powder only and fire it at the side of the horse. The horse might get well. 27 If the owner was wealthy or the horse was a valuable buffalo runner or racer the Blackfoot owner generally preferred to take no chances. He called upon one of the powerful horse medicine men to treat his mount. The horse medicine man was paid well for his services. (See pp. 270-271.)

It was also considered desirable to limit the number of children. Two years was the standard interval, but the longer the time between siblings, the more parents demonstrated their love for the child previously born. Moreover, abortion carried no stigma. Magic help for this purpose could be easily secured from an authorized female practitioner, and as a special favor, a stop could be put to childbearing altogether. Revealingly, barrenness is never given as a cause for divorce in this competitive society where women are highly prized as property and sex objects, and where marriage is notoriously unstable.

In competition with the hospital are a number of medical practitioners who earn fees from their services. These persons are usually specialists for swellings, blood poisoning, female complaints, etc., and nearly every cluster of houses can produce at least one such practitioner. The income derived from this source is, however, usually small, so that this knowledge is no guarantee of an abundant life. A shirt or a blanket is a typical gift from the patient, or in the case of a spectacular and painstaking cure, a piece of furniture or a horse.

The Blackfeet have a superstition that a doctor should not relate his dreams (sources of inspiration), nor reveal his methods, nor hand them down to others. On the other hand, leaders of religious ceremonials were expected to teach their rituals to anyone who made a vow to purchase them. Sometimes a doctor was a specialist, his power being confined, by the command received in his dream, to a certain form of sickness.
Because the presence of spectators is believed to weaken the doctor’s power, even the patient’s family [Page 248] are ordinarily excluded from the ceremony. As I had never been permitted to witness a medicine man’s methods of doctoring, I fully expected to be asked to withdraw. To my surprise, Awunna called upon me to assist in the incantations, saying that if I would join in the chants it would give him greater power in his doctoring. I consented, but asked for permission to photograph the ceremonial during his visit on the following morning. Awunna hesitated and Ekitowaki, his wife, at once raised objections, but it was decided in my favour by the patient himself, who requested that the pictures be taken, so that I could explain to the white people the Blackfeet methods of doctoring.

“For many years I have helped to support my family by catching eagles. I dispose of most of the feathers among the South Piegans, who use them for their headdresses and medicine bonnets. It is very difficult and exhausting work to take eagles alive. When I was a young man my father taught me his methods, for he was a skilled eagle-catcher. I camp in an unfrequented place, near the foot of the mountains. After digging a deep hole, so that I can stand erect inside, I kill a coyote and stretch the tanned hide on sticks, with raw meat laid along the sides, as if it had just been cut open. Long before sunrise, I enter the hole, covering the top over with branches and leaves. The coyote bait lies on top, just over my head. I must stand in the hole all day, not able to eat, nor drink, nor even smoke, lest the eagles scent the smoke. All day long I chant the coyote medicine song, ‘I want the eagles to eat my body.’
The power of this song draws the eagles towards the bait. First I see the Mami-as-ich-imi (Long Tails or Magpies) coming. They walk around chattering [Page 429] and talking, saying to each other over and over again, ‘Magpies go on ahead, and hang your sack upon a tree.’ An eagle sees the Longtails feasting, and swoops down beside the bait. He first walks suspiciously around and around the coyote, and at last steps over upon the branches and begins to eat. I then push my hands through the branches and, grasping him firmly, first by one leg and then by the other, I pull him quickly down into the hole, and kill him by breaking his back with my foot. In this way the wings fall to either side, and the feathers are uninjured. After sunset, my wife comes to the pit with food. She uncovers the top and helps me out. I desire most to catch the Peta (Golden Eagle), because its feathers are the most valuable. Its head and breast are light brown, with white beneath the wings. Its tail feathers are also white, with black tips. We never use Black Eagles, and White Heads (Bald Eagles) are very scarce, as well as dangerous. They are so strong, they have almost lifted me out of the pit.
“In former days, when grizzly bears were plentiful, eagle-catching was very dangerous. I remember one Indian, who was in his pit, when a big grizzly came to the bait, and started to drag it away. The man foolishly held to his bait, and the bear turned to investigate. He scratched off the branches and, seeing a man in the hole, dragged him out and, in a rage, tore him to pieces. His friends found nothing but his bones. There are now so many white men in the country, it is difficult to find a locality wild enough to catch eagles. At present I go to a place on the other side of the Porcupine Mountains.”
Pointing towards the north, Brings-down-the-Sun said: “You can see from here the highest peak of the Porcupine Mountains. It is surrounded by a thick [Page 430] forest and no trail leads to that peak. Its summit is precipitous and covered with scrub pines. You will notice that our most severe storms come from the direction of that peak. When my eldest son died, I felt his loss so deeply, that I climbed to its summit and lay there fasting, for ten days and ten nights. During that time I had a dream, in which the Spirit of the Mountain appeared and gave me a Medicine Robe with a song. He instructed me how to make the robe, and said that, if I used it in doctoring, or when I appeared before the assembled people, I would be endowed with wisdom and supernatural power.

Prestige.—Don was born in March, 1890, into the Sun clan. He had a five-year-old sister, Gladys, and a two-year-old brother, Ira, who was still nursing. 4 Not only was Don at pains, fifty years later, to tell the signs which had portended greatness for him, but he had been considerably preoccupied with the idea of his own importance early in his childhood. Don's mother, when she was pregnant, had been told that she was carrying twins, but a medicine man succeeded in bringing the two babies together into one, 5 Don believes. “My mother also helped to bring us [twins] together by her strong wish for only one baby” (58, p. 25). 6 After his birth, his relatives could tell from his double hair-whorls that indeed he had been twins that had united into one baby. This was considered a sign that, even as a child, he was capable of exercising the healer's art, and that he would develop into an expert in hunting, herding, and curing. His parents tried to impress him with this view of the future as soon as he could understand them. Very early his behavior showed that he had remarkable “antelope power,” an attribute of twins. His feelings of possessing unusual qualities were fostered by his beloved maternal grandfather, who took or pretended to take Don's claims to power very seriously (58, pp. 40–41). Don was his favorite grandchild. He taught Don healing techniques which permitted him to validate himself as an important child. Don could cure people who had trouble urinating, by massaging them in the area of the groin. Although there was danger that a patient might die, Don felt that he could distinguish those who were fatally ill and refused to treat them. These powers, in his childhood, earned him prestige with his parents, with the people of Oraibi, and particularly with his grandfather. They even compensated for his poor ability as a runner. But his grandfather [Page 30] pointed out not only the possibilities but also the limitations of Don's future career. The old man said that Don's power would fade before he grew up. He could never be a good healer in adult life, since he was not a member of the Badger or the Snake clan, whose members made the best doctors. He might, however, become an important leader and a special officer in the ceremonies. Nevertheless, Don always hoped that his ceremonial father would take him into his own important societies—Wowochim, Fire, and Snake—and was once told that he might later be chosen to enter the Snake society. (The wish to enter the Snake society ran all through Don's childhood and youth. One motivation was presumably the wish to become a healer.) Don also points out that, on his mother's side, he had important relatives in the village 7 —men who showed a great deal of interest in him—and that he was related to the future Village chief, Tewaquaptewa.

In love magic an individual or generalized bait object is used, but no bait receptacle is employed. Either an expert wizard or a layman may perform love magic. The love sorcerer in both cases is termed Dï′SGi avu'. A layman who ardently desires a certain girl steals some of her hair, her saliva (Dï′DZ'va˙la), a piece of her shawl, or some threads from her woven [Page 8] belt. These objects together with a prayer feather he ties up in a package. He prays that the girl will desire him and puts the package in his pocket or under his belt (formerly, inside the waist band of his breech cloth). The girl becomes “on fire under her navel” and as long as he carries the package she visits him every night. “This love magic is dangerous. The girl and the man may go mad with love and kill themselves.” The bait objects are disposed of by burial when the man becomes tired of the girl: he makes a new package if he desires another mistress.
The expert love magician works with a special Dï′sGiaf DixBo′ne, “love sorcerer's medicine bundle.” A man who desires a certain girl goes to the sorcerer and asks his help. The wizard gets out his DixBo′ne.
In carrying out his love magic the wizard holds the DixBo′ne in front of him and sings songs to it, joining the name of the man to the name of the girl. This excites the girl and she soon comes to the man's bed. The wizard who is hired in this way is recompensed by the gift of the man's sister or other female relative as his mistress for as long as he wishes. Some experts may use the DixBo′ne on their own account, in which case they become irresistible to all women in the village. Informant mentioned the name of an individual who was an exceedingly successful love expert on his own account.
More within the realm of folk belief is the work of the sorcerer who overcomes the resistance of recalcitrant young people by removing their hearts when they are asleep and hiding these in a jar. Such young people join the sorcerers' meetings and allow the latter freely to amuse themselves with their youthful bodies. The young people become sick. The medicine man treating such a case must find and restore the heart of the sick person before a cure is effective. Women as well as men may be love experts or practice the layman's love magic. One woman mentioned by informants is reputed to have become rich through gifts made her by men she has attracted to her bed.

When the position of the embryo within the womb becomes distorted and causes pain to the mother, she consults a medicine man who skillfully and painlessly pushes it back into its correct place. All of the women I spoke to had received this treatment at various times, some even two or three times during one pregnancy. No medicine man (Dï˙hi'G ia') in either of these villages is peculiarly a specialist in obstetrics. The one most often consulted at the present time is a highly thought of “bone doctor.” Another who is rapidly gaining fame as an obstetrician, is one who, without previous training or other equipment, recently entered the profession. He caused considerable anxiety to a young girl who knew she was pregnant by telling her that in point of fact, her womb harbored a growing tumor and that she would never be able to produce offspring to carry on the name of [Page 28] her clan. His opinion was over-ruled by government medical specialists, but the outcome of the pregnancy is not known to me. There is no bargaining over payment for the service of the native specialist, nor is there in fact, institutionalized payment. He is given a gift of corn meal or whatever else is handy if and when his client feels so inclined. His attitude is one of public spiritedness in the highest degree. 1 On one occasion a medicine man dropped his agricultural and herding activities for several days to stay day and night in the home of a parturient mother. Her labor was both long and painful. Added to this, she was frightened by the fact that two women had recently died in childbirth. The patient service of the medicine man was indeed appreciated, though no special attention was paid him.

Much of the curing of illness is done by the ceremonial societies, each of which appears to specialize in the cure of specific disease or illness, through the agency of the ranking chiefs or priests of the society in question. Payment for cures thus effected consists in joining the appropriate society or else providing a feast for the next society ritual performance. There are today, however, and probably were also in the past, medical specialists not, I think, affiliated with the curing societies. They make a practice of diagnosing and treating various ailments ranging, in typical cases, from over-due childbirth to persistent ulcers on the leg or acute stomach trouble. When such an expert is called, the practice at Second Mesa is for the patient, should he feel inclined, to repay the expert's attention by a gift of food at some indefinite future date, though should the illness be serious and the cure properly appreciated by the patient, a gift of food will immediately be made to the medicine man. ... In any case the pattern of payment seems to vary slightly at First Mesa where, according to Stephen, a preliminary gift of nominal value, usually a few yards of cloth, is always made before consultation takes place and is followed by more substantial gifts of food and materials after treatment is finished. At Second as at First Mesa, however, the pattern is to assume indifference as to the size of the gifts and to accept whatever is offered with no overt comment other than the conventional word of thanks. Though specialists called in from another mesa receive no special payments, it is not uncommon for a Hopi expert to travel long distances to treat a sick Navaho and to receive large fees for the extra trouble involved in such consultations. It may be noticed in this connection that a specialist in sorcery, BOWa˙'[unknown]a, might be hired to cause illness or death in a third individual and would be paid with turquoise, beads or a woman's dress for his services. A love sorcerer, Dï˙sGiavu'', engaged by a man to turn the affections of a girl [Page 22] in a definite direction, would be paid with similar goods, or in lieu of these, the man would give the sorcerer his own sister or other female relative to act as his mistress for as long as the sorcerer desired her.
2 A curing society, now died out at Second Mesa, which held public kiva ceremonies to exorcise witch-craft, though individual society members practiced private curing. Initiates chose as their ceremonial godfather either the eagle or the field mouse.

A mother should not attempt to treat the sick baby herself, although a few mothers do so. If the mother is dissatisfied with the treatment of the medicine man first called, she should not go to a second practitioner until four days have elapsed, but here, as elsewhere, practice does not conform to theory, and an anxious mother may call several medicine men in rapid succession. In severe cases the parents may promise that if he recovers the child will be given, as a member, to one of the societies. As a last resort, they may call the government nurse or the government doctor.

So many were the tricks they performed, there was no telling what they would do next. Soon the practitioners or medicine men began to exercise the Ya Ya powers for their own selfish and often evil purposes, and people began to be afraid of them. Then again they were afflicted with the disease of the eyes, and were asked to leave Oraibi. It is said they took all the fetishes representing their animals to seal up in a cave in the cliffs west of Oraibi. Here the fetishes still remain.

Ekigei wegii, “to perform surgery with a flint knife .” Kapauku surgeons are skilled at extracting arrows from battle wounds and at making incisions with a flint knife ( ekigei ), either in, or near the wound, in order to let out the infected blood. While charging only 5 b if the patient survives, they collect 60 b in case of his death. The increased charge in the latter situation is due to the Kapauku conviction that they [Page 326] must compensate the surgeon for his suffering over his client’s death, and for the danger he faces of a possible attack by the evil spirit who killed the man he tried to save. Because Botukebo lacks a surgeon, all cases requiring surgical attention are referred to skilled practitioners in the allied villages of Jagauwauii, Aigii, and Bunauwobado. During the investigated eight months only two surgical operations were performed, costing Botukebo residents 10 b . It is obvious from the sum that both patients survived.

Bukwakaa ego duwai, “to cut the gum,” and ego badii, “to extract teeth.” Kapauku dentists fall into two categories—the gum cutters and the extractionists. The gum cutters cure a toothache by incising the gum with a bamboo knife, thus removing the pressure of the abscess. For such a service there is usually no charge. Ijaaj Jikiiwiijaaj (3/2) is the expert of this art in Botukebo. An extractionist, on the other hand, usually requires a payment of 5 b per operation, provided the patient did not bite him. Such an accident easily happens because the practitioner uses his fingers as instruments. Should the patient misbehave and hurt the dentist, the fee is doubled. Unfortunately, Botukebo cannot boast of an extractionist; the nearest one lives in Aigii. During the eight-month period of 1955, no Botukebo residents had recourse to this specialist.

The setting sun is a sign to stop the fighting. Both rival armies perform a “ waita tai, a counterclockwise circular dance,” and leave for their homes in the same fashion as they arrived at the battlefield—women in front, on the flanks and in the rear, and men in the middle. The wounded people are carried back to their villages on the shoulders of their fellow warriors. There, a skilled surgeon extracts the projectiles and makes an incision with a flint flake near the wound in order to let out the blood. This is also the time for the shaman to perform curative magic on wounded men and preventive magic for the healthy people. The dead are tied by their hands and feet to a pole and carried to the village where they are placed on a platform with the arrows left in their bodies. No war prisoners are taken. Instead, all the enemy are killed on the spot.

There are a few other specialists, besides the traders, who sell their services to people. The shaman’s and sorcerer’s professions have already been discussed. In addition to these, there are expert surgeons who are skilled at taking out arrows from a wound and at making an incision with a flint knife, either in the wound or nearby, to let out the infected blood. If one survives, one pays only five beads for the best treatment. Since one’s eventual death is believed never to be related to the surgeon’s lack of skill but rather to an attack by an evil spirit, the surgeon charges the mourning heirs sixty beads instead of the normal small amount. The difference in price is paid because the doctor suffers by being sorry about the death of one he so eagerly tried to save. Dentists classify themselves in two categories: gum cutters, who save the teeth by incising the gum with a bamboo knife thus relieving the pressure, and extractionists. The writer watched an operation performed by a gum cutter on a patient who had suffered for seven days and whose pain could not be relieved by aspirin supplied by the writer. The patient became well in one day after a single incision. In more serious cases, the patient has to make an appointment with the extractionist. These specialists are rigorous in their business and are offended if one pleads with them to save the tooth. “You just go [Page 129] to Jikiiwiijaaj with this kind of work, I will not do it,” was the angry reply by an extractionist from Aigii to a man who asked only to have his gum incised. An extractionist cuts open the gum with a bamboo knife and extracts the tooth with his fingers. Two helpers hold the patient’s head while he is lying on his back during the operation. If it hurts severely, the dentist may give one “anesthesia” by kneeling on one’s stomach. This miraculously distracts one’s attention, holds down the body, stops the patient from hollering by forcing the air out of his lungs, opens his mouth, and permits the “doctor” to complete his task undisturbed. While for gum cutting the dentist does not charge at all, one has to pay five beads for an extraction. The fee may be doubled if one has bitten the practitioner.

The most frequent and the most important types of white magical rites are those concerned with curing disease. After a man has been “attacked by an evil spirit which tries to remove his soul” he turns for help to a shaman. The practitioner, applying all his skill and knowledge, tries to expel the evil spirit from the body of the patient either by bribing it or by forcing it out with the help of his own guardian spirit. Almost every magical cure that I have witnessed differed from the others in individual selection of the elements of the magical rites, over-all organization of the procedure, sequence of the technique, and wording of the particular spells. The shamans also differ in their eloquence and their knowledge of lore and the use of the various paraphernalia. However, they all make use of certain elements of magical performance that are the property of the profession. Some of the most frequently used and, therefore, important elements of curative magic follow. Every magical procedure that I have observed started with a prayer by the shaman to the sun and moon Creator and to the shaman’s guardian spirits. During the performance that follows, a shaman invariably uses a magically powerful plant. Its selection often depends on the diagnosis of the cause of the disease. As a rule the evil spirits are associated with particular plants. However, the most generally used plant, often utilized next to that which a particular spirit requires, is the [Page 81] green variety of the ti plant. Its stem, with a few leaves left at its end, is a repellent of most of the evil spirits. The shaman carries it around his patient, touches the head and other parts of the body with it, shakes it furiously, and thus expels the spirit that causes the disease. Very often the plants are used together with glowing embers. The whole bundle, consisting of both ingredients, is moved counterclockwise, followed immediately by clockwise circles, around the patient’s head. This performance is almost always accompanied by involved, repetitive spells, uttered rapidly by the shaman, and by his spitting on the embers as well as around the patient. Since water is believed to have a purifying force the shaman and the sick man apply it freely to different parts of their bodies. The spirits are almost always bribed by the plants and glowing embers —augmented by sacrificial small birds, rats, or intestines of some larger animals—into leaving the body of the patient. Toward the end of the rite these offerings are hung on a pole, or thrown behind the shaman into the bush. The procedure may be combined with performances during which a shaman extracts, by sleight of hand, an evil object from the patient’s body. The practitioner may also try to recapture the patient’s soul on the end of the ti plant broom and reintroduce it into the sick man’s body. The magician’s trance, as well as his dreams, may also be employed in the cure. Through these the shaman claims to have learned the cause of the illness as well as the remedy for it. At the end of a magical ceremony he suggests some special observances that the patient must follow as a continuation of his cure. For a period of time, or for the rest of his life, he may be ordered to refrain from eating certain species of food plants or animals. As condition for a complete recovery the patient may be requested to manifest his generosity. This consists usually of killing a pig and distributing its meat free to the public. Sometimes he may also be asked to set aside a certain quantity of cowries for his son’s inheritance.

Gomaya was a case in point. The five sons of To'uluwa and Kadamwasila were all pleasant and clever, attractive and enterprising, and were all renowned for their love magic. As a matter of fact, the first and last of the formula here given I received from Yobukwa'u who, knowing only two out of the four charms, yet achieved an incestuous love-affair with his father's youngest wife, several adulteries, and two engagements one after the other. All these affairs were attributed to love magic; as was the case with Kalogusa, his younger brother, who subdued Yobukwa'u's fiancée, Isepuna. Another of the five brothers, Gilayviyaka, with whose intrigues too we are already acquainted, was also reputed to be an expert at love magic. Many more examples could be adduced, but it is better to keep to the more notorious cases.
Bagido'u, the nephew and heir-apparent of the principal chief, an extremely intelligent and pleasant informant, was ill of some internal wasting sickness, probably tuberculosis. We have already heard of his domestic [Page 377] mishaps, the defection of his handsome wife, who left him in order to join her late sister's husband, Manimuwa, a young, healthy and handsome man of Wakayse (see ch. vi, sec. I). She often visited her sister, and during the latter's last illness she stayed for a long time with her brother-in-law. The issue was obvious: Manimuwa and Dakiya formed an attachment and entered upon an illicit intrigue, which ended in her joining him. Magic was blamed for all the trouble. Even Bagido'u himself, the deserted husband, would say that she was a good woman, but that this bad man had first performed evil magic to estrange her from her husband, and afterwards love magic to seduce her. Dakiya, in fact, was quoted as the classical instance of the power of magic. “Magic made the mind of Dakiya; Manimuwa only remains in her mind.” The comic side of this otherwise sad story was that Bagido'u had the reputation of being the greatest expert in the magic of love. Of course, my informants were ready with explanations of the theoretical conundrums involved.

Mr Bellamy says; 'Children are desired, especially boy children. A barren woman is not perhaps despised, but in the event of a quarrel with another woman, her childlessness might be "thrown in her face" as a reproach. A megua tau (medicine man) is occasionally called in to "doctor" the bareness; his mode of procedure is incantation and a harmless drink a decoction of some native root' 1
'A megua tau differs for a tobwagaru, although sometimes the professions are combined in the same individual. Tobwagaw is a sorcerer whose help is obtained and paid for to get rid of an enemy, why a megua tau medicines people, dogs, gardens, canoes, winds, weather and so forth' [The megua tau is in fact an expert practicing beneficent magic.]

Of course, the spell may fail. The words may not have been strong enough, and the lover may seek another expert who has access to spells thought to be even more powerful. In some cases, because the expert was not paid enough, he or she deliberately may not have chanted the words for the necessary length of time. Trobrianders believe that the agent carrying the magic only becomes effective when the words are chanted again and again throughout the night or for several days so that the betel nut or tobacco absorbs its power from the act of speech itself. 7 Therefore, additional payments finally may produce success. Yet counters to this magic exist: For example, when a woman (or a man) finds herself totally lost in her longings for the man who wants her, a relative who knows an equally powerful magic spell may be able to remove the debilitating effects of the original spell. Even under the best circumstances, however, a suspecting woman simply may refuse the betel nut and remain free to choose someone else. In the final analysis, even the most formidable love magic can be averted, making love relationships as full of chance as any other relationship.

A whole succession of natives, especially old women, understand massaging (roa) very well. Massaging is done to set dislocated joints, to draw sores to a head, for stomach-aches, rheumatism, and asthma. The persons who do the massaging rub their hands with oil, in part out of consideration for the patient, in part for the sake of their own hands. Then they begin to massage, sometimes with the palm of the hand, sometimes with the fingertips, sometimes tenderly, sometimes firmly. The asthma patients have to sit down, and the medical practitioner rubs their backs vigorously from top to bottom with both hands. One day a ripe coconut fell from a palm and heavily grazed the head of a woman passing by. A man immediately rushed up, massaged her head, and pressed it together so that “the sutures do not come apart.”
The massaging is done according to very definite rules and is not familiar to everybody. Good masseurs are popular and many an old man has married an equally old woman because she was a good masseuse. Out of all the medical knowledge of the Truk people the roa is the only thing that is sensible and useful.

In times of war it often happened that a hole would be made in a native’s forehead or some other part of the head by a skillful stone slinger. It is said that on the islands then there were a number of medical practitioners who were able to construct an artificial closure. They took a piece of coconut shell, scraped, cleaned, and fitted it into the hole, and let the skin grow over it. I was told this on various islands, also by people who claimed to have been eyewitnesses.
There are hundreds of experts in medicine (sousafei) who are ready to cure all kinds of suffering for a good payment on all the Truk Islands. One sousafei understands this medicine, another one that one. Now these medicines have nothing to do with the actual nature of the ailment. They are only supposed to paralyze the evil influence of the spirits. The pue must find out which spirit has bitten the patient, and furthermore the medicine which should be applied, as well as the house into which the patient should be put. If the disease does not subside, the patient is carried somewhere else, and another medicine is tried. Many a patient who is conveyed over mountain and valley on a stretcher or to other islands on a canoe is taken to his death during this.
Everything possible is used for the preparation of medicines: plants, tree roots, earth, and the like, and, what is more, in any given case those selected have a certain similarity to the illness in question.

The fourth important valuable is not an object at all but rather a form of incorporeal property known as magic or special knowledge. As we shall see in Chapter X, there are types of special knowledge relating to medicine and curing, house and canoe construction, navigation, sorcery, divination, and fighting. In general, only older people have special knowledge. A person does not usually begin studying it until [Page 61] he has reached the age of thirty. Not everyone in the older generations possesses special knowledge. It is carefully guarded from outsiders and can only be learned from a close kinsman, or purchased at considerable expense from a non-kinsmen. In most cases mastery of the lore is a complex and difficult process and various taboos must be adhered to during and after the apprenticeship. Approximately one-third of the adults over thirty have special knowledge. A few people are experts in several different forms of special knowledge; some know one kind, and some know only fragments of one kind. Although everyone knows that many kinds of special knowledge exists, any particular type is important because few others share it.
Each consists of ghostly powers which allow the possessor to perform significant actions that are outside the sphere of normal human ability. All forms of knowledge can also be sold, that is, taught to others in exchange for land, food, goods, or other special knowledge. In addition, most knowledge benefits the specialist, because other people must pay him for using his techniques for their benefit. A specialist in the curing of diseases associated with pregnancy and childbirth spoke as follows:
“It’s this way with my knowledge. I sit here, and if a woman is sick, her husband comes to me and asks, ‘Please will you treat my wife?’ Then her people will make goods and gather goods and they will put them down before me, If I work five days (on the curing), I will not have to gather food once. To the person of special knowledge, food, goods, and land just come in.”
Possession of special knowledge also relates in many ways to the character values. It makes one a person of consequence. It also increases his aggressive power, since most special knowledge includes sorcery by means of which other persons may be injured or killed. “Knowledge allows you to outdo your opponents and to laugh with derision. It lets you say ‘ah hah, you are wounded’.” Many tests of character are associated with use of special knowledge. To demonstrate his [Page 62] strong thought, a person should acquire this knowledge, but out of respectfulness he should be modest about the extent of his powers; to show “pride in knowledge” ( sikerong) is arrogance. On the other hand, all others should offer proper deference to the specialist, that is respectfulness on their part. Among the inventory of respectful behaviors there is a polite term, fewuuwicho, which people who are building a house should say to a specialist in the lore of houses, should he happen to walk by while they are working on the house. To utter this term acknowledges the master builder’s special power and status. It is equivalent to saying, “I humbly pay respects to your power. Please don’t sorcerize my house.” Failure to offer this token of respect would be taken as an indication that the workers consider the expert a person of little power who needs not be respected, or that they regard their own powers as superior. Because this is an arrogant challenge, the specialist is considered fully justified if he uses sorcery in retaliation.
The ideal type is a person of respectfulness, bravery, and strong thought who also controls abundant valuables. He fulfills his obligations generously, cares for numerous dependents, makes grand gifts of land, outdoes his rivals in competitive projects, and, with his bravery and special knowledge, he defeats his enemies by direct attack or sorcery. Such a person is described, in complimentary fashion, as “nearly a ghost” ( arapakkan enu). His mastery approaches that of the supernaturals.

Some curers specialize in the treatment of particular organs ( e.g., eyes or liver), others deal with health problems connected with pregnancy and childbirth, and still others specialize in particular types of injury or disease ( e.g., broken bones or possession by sea demon).
In most cases the specialist knows how to prepare “medicine” ( sáfey) which, when somehow directed at the patient—by [Page 145] rubbing it on him, steaming him, having him drink it, or simply placing it near him—will cure or prevent a disease. Alternative forms of treatment involve spells or massage. Sometimes, there is an explicit theory about how the cure works. The medicine for possession by sea demon is said to smell so bad to the spirit that it drives him out. In other cases, the mechanics of the cure are unknown.
A curer is seen as matching his powers against the forces of the disease, and any successful cure is a triumph. Like other specialists, curers compete over their reputations as when one expert’s treatment fails but another’s succeeds. As an ally of one curer said, “She is the absolute number one at that curing, (in comparison) the others just understand a little.” Usually the curer knows how to cause the diseases he or she treats. An expert in childbearing can ease delivery but she can also torture a woman by prolonging it or cause her to die in the process. For this reason curers have the power and status of sorcerers.

Some people say that love magic is sorcery, but most consider it a distinct specialty. The usual goal is to make a victim fall in love with the practitioner or his client. It is close to sorcery because of its stealth and compulsion and also because the more powerful types may kill a person or drive him insane. Victims may break out in sores, engage in fits of screaming and rolling around in the dirt, and rip off their clothes. Many of the specialist’s techniques involve spells that call on a female spirit to change the emotions of the victim. He also makes a special medicine, “perfume of evil” ( nééngngaw), from fragrant plants and trees such as tumeric. The client annoints himself with this medicine or applies it directly to his victim.
As we have seen, love magic is frequently used by young men or women who are interested in someone who disdains them. One type, “fast returning” ( soratapwan), compels the return of someone who has abandoned his or her spouse. With this medicine, [Page 148] they can “reel in the deserter like a fish.” Another type, “gluing” ( apachapach) serves to stick a victim’s thoughts solely on the expert’s client. Occasionally the rival specialists confront each other as when an expert working for the wife’s kin group trys to bring back a deserting husband, while the latter pays another specialist for protection. More commonly rivals compete over their reputations. The specialist is viewed as pitting his power against the contrary inclinations of his victim. Success against a difficult subject, such as a Catholic nun or someone who is in love with another person, is considered a special triumph.
A.N., a specialist in love magic, and her husband had sailed with some kinsmen to a reef islet to cut copra. The couple argued, and the husband left and returned to Fáánakkar. A.N. prepared some medicine, worked her spells, and announced that her husband would be back again the next morning. That night a storm came up, it rained all night and the waters of the lagoon were rough. It seemed unlikely that anyone would attempt the long journey. At dawn, however, the people could see a canoe approaching. Of course it was A.N.’s husband. He had left the evening before and paddled all night through the storm.

The master of strategy is the most respected, feared, and powerful practitioner of special knowledge. He has three related powers.
1. He knows one or more dialects of the secret “language of itang” ( fóósun itang) or “deep speech” ( kkapas mwónómwón), and he knows historical oral narratives in this language.
2. He is a master of thinking and “strategy” ( raaw), he is astute in discerning the motivations of others and manipulating them to his own advantage, and he knows esoteric ploys and maneuvers for outdoing others in warfare, formal meetings, and other contests.
3. He controls powerful sorcery, which he uses against his enemies including rival masters of strategy.
The secret language follows the grammatical patterns of standard Trukese, but it is laced with cryptic distortions. Secret words, altered regular words, regular words with special meanings, and esoteric metaphors make this language incomprehensible to those who speak only standard Trukese. Masters of strategy use this language among themselves and in speeches at formal meetings. It is also the medium in which they preserve “significant history” ( wuruwo), that is, history that justifies claims to valuables. It includes knowledge about the background of kin groups, about the way in which the chiefly title has passed among different groups, and the way in which plots of land have reached their present owners. Sometimes information is coded into cryptic derivations of the names of lineages, districts, or islands. Sometimes it is preserved in oral narratives, memorized word for word in the secret language. One history describes the flight of a giant man-of-war bird. As it flies along the barrier reef the ownership of different reef islands is explained. Another history tells how a ghost from the sky world invested an island’s chieftainship in a particular kin group. The first history justifies ownership of reef islands, the second validates a claim to the chieftainship, but neither is universally accepted.
Such histories are spoken at appropriate meetings and are used when claims to valuables are in dispute. In such situations rival specialists, seeking to expand and preserve the holdings of their kin groups, districts, or islands, “flight with history.” Triumph in such contests involves more than accurate knowledge and persuasive argument. One aspect of the expert’s strategy is the fabrication of histories which provide authoritative and convincing support for claims that his group wishes to advance. Naturally, those who dispute a history may assert that it is false, but sometimes even those who support the history acknowledge that it was created to win some dispute. The specialist triumphs when he takes valuables from the opposition by intimidating them with false history.
In warfare, the master of strategy helped to plan attacks. He devised clever tactics for deceiving and defeating the enemy, [Page 150] and he knew formal methods for deploying formations of warriors and war canoes. These maneuvers combined pragmatic strategies with esoteric ideas about the relationships of the right and wrong sides of people and canoes. The expert also tried to work sorcery on the enemy. One kind rendered the enemy warriors so sluggish and confused that they “forgot what they saw” and were unable to defend themselves. When his strategy of sorcery was successful, the enemy were said to have feared, lost to, or been injured by the expert’s power.
Rival masters of strategy often attempt to kill each other; their encounters at formal meetings are usually sorcery battles. On the surface it seems like a respectful occasion, but throughout the meeting rivals mutter spells and seek to outmaneuver their opponents.
When an expert is “bitten” by the sorcery of his rivals he may not fall ill for days. In other cases he is struck down at once. If he is giving a speech, his words become hesitant and garbled; then he collapses on the sand floor of the meeting house and spews out bloody vomit and exrement. If he is rushed out of the meeting house and given appropriate medicine, he sometimes survives. This kind of collapse occurred regularly in the traditional society and it has happened occasionally during the modern period, sometimes at meetings officially devoted to Christian religious subjects. Suggestibility probably plays some part, especially if the victim feels he has made an error in maneuvering.
Because he is regularly tested by the sorcery of his rivals, an expert must practice techniques that increase his powers. One used the following methods:
He arose before dawn, left a special screened off section of the house where he slept, and walked to a beach that faced east. There he greeted the sunrise, singing out spells and pounding on the left side of his chest. In this way he intensified his power and made his words fiery, hot and dangerous. Returning to his house, he cast further spells. No one could safely talk to him, and children were silenced. On a routine day, he concluded with spells that temporarily lowered his power [Page 151] so that he and his kinsmen could discuss the activities of the day.

Trukese midwives are reputed experts in the diagnosis of early pregnancy. One informant said:
[The American doctor] misses more than the doctor of the kanaaka. He says the woman is sick [when she is actually only pregnant]. When you make a baby, some of them just come up in your stomach, and some come up at the side of your back and hide there. Then, when the baby gets big, this is a bad place for it because there is no room to grow at the side of the back. Therefore, perhaps while you are asleep, you get a big pain. The pain is caused by the baby turning into your belly. The American doctor is not able to diagnose this kind of pregnancy until the baby turns, which it does when it gets a body—arms, etc. [AL note: author goes on to confirm higher skill among midwives, compared to other doctors.]

The more complicated types of manufacture, as well as most of the esoteric activities of healing, sorcery, magic, divination, navigation, and the like, are undertaken almost entirely by older people. A man will usually not begin to learn the skills of boat building until he has reached middle age, when he is forty years old or older. There is a feeling that until this time men are too young and irresponsible, preoccupied with their love affairs and given to idling and visiting. There is no question that with this age comes a release from the need felt for extensive sexual activity, and as the skilled manufactures as well as more esoteric activities formerly required complete sexual continence for their success and still do to a lesser extent, there is no doubt that a potential conflict of some magnitude has been resolved by this device.

One area in which esoteric procedures apparently retain their full aboriginal vitality and validity is that of curing the ill. The Trukese will submit readily to preventive innoculations and vaccinations and will line up for medication for pains and coughs, but when they are seriously ill the overwhelming majority remain at home to be treated by Trukese medicine. This treatment is essentially magical and consists either in exorcising or more commonly simply placating the ghost or other spirit which has entered the body of the person and is eating it, or in counteracting the effects of sorcery which, while on the wane, is still considered an active source of disease. Diagnosis is symptomatic and episodic: the relevant questions are where does it hurt, where has the person been recently, what was he doing? A diviner is then usually called in to determine what treatment should be used, and then which of those practitioners who know this treatment is the proper one to call. It is significant that it is only for diagnosis of illness that the diviner is still consistently called upon, although he may on occasion be asked to deliberate on other matters. If the practitioner selected is agreeable he begins his treatment, for a fee which may be large or small depending on whether the patient is a relative or not. The treatment may consist in steaming the affected portion of the body from a bowl which contains seawater and a plant appropriate to the disease into which is dropped a rock heated in a fire. As the steam rises, a chant is recited calling upon the offending spirit to depart from his evil works. Or medication may be rubbed, sprinkled, or poured upon the body, a spell being recited the while, or medicated coconut water or the like prepared for drinking, and amulets prepared for protection (especially against sorcery). Formerly, but apparently no longer on Truk, a spirit medium could also be called upon to communicate more directly with the spirit and find out just what he was annoyed about. [Page 65] Concurrently with magical therapy there exists a large body of massage techniques known again to specialists; while these are used primarily in cases of injury, and are often very effective, they are also used in the cure of diseases characterized by aches and pains in the joints, some sorts of abdominal pain, and so on.

It is felt, however, that younger men cannot long deny themselves the pleasures of women, and it is probably largely for this reason that they do not undertake the more specialized and skilled types of work which occupy an increasing amount of the time of many older men. Some types of magic, particularly those pertaining to war and learning the skills of warfare, formerly imposed sexual taboos on younger men also; these were more easily maintained when living in the lineage men’s house. Both warfare and the men’s house are now in the past and there are very few occasions left in which younger men must observe ritual continence on Truk. Older men, however, continue to observe the taboos, particularly during the manufacture of such objects as canoes and their equipment; these skills and their associated magic are not taught to younger men. In tabulating the makers of canoes, paddles, bailers, wooden fish spears, and the like, Dr. LeBar found that the youngest among them was listed as being thirty-nine years of age (which is probably a low estimate on the part of the island secretary), and they averaged forty-seven. They all observe to some degree the magic traditionally associated with their craft and are stated to avoid intercourse with their wives until their task is done, although they continue to sleep at home. They have learned their skills from yet older men and will shortly pass them on to men somewhat younger, in both cases members of their lineage or other close relatives.

Although women, as we have noted, do not have to avoid heterosexual contacts as a consequence of any work they may undertake, they like the men tend to learn skills only after they are well into adult status. The principal crafts practiced by women are the making of nets, baskets, and plaited fans; the average age for producers of these items on Romonum was found by LeBar to be forty-one. However, at least one woman skilled in the manufacture of each of these items was in her early twenties, and both Irene and Rachel were taught these and other crafts when still in their teens. Although these are exceptions, such exceptions do not appear in the case of male artisans.

A revealing illustration of the mixture of feelings which a niffag may entail was given by an informant who was discussing the taboos surrounding a magical specialist. The particular specialist has it in his power to make another person who has offended him sick by inviting the latter to share with him a meal consisting of taboo food. The victim later gathers together sufficient goods to make a handsome present to the specialist, who is also the only one who knows the cure. As our informant put it, the specialist now “likes” his victim and prepares the necessary medicine to remove the affliction. A niffag is thus felt to have the power to change another’s attitude even when its purpose is perfectly clear.

The above considerations are extended by analogy to knowledge and skills which do not in their application directly create corporeal property, such, for example, as the magical and medicinal formulae used to cure illness. Knowledge of this kind is freely applied to the curing of a lineage mate or other close relative as a personal favor. Any one else, however, must pay in advance. The patient brings goods to the specialist and requests his aid. When cured, he is further obligated to the practioner and makes him a present. Such knowledge, then, not only has practical social value, but through its application can provide other forms of wealth for the specialist. To this knowledge, too, the specialist’s children and lineage mates have a claim. Without their permission, he may not teach it to another unless he receives compensation for it. For if the specialist teaches someone else, he dissipates the monopoly his heirs will someday enjoy and lowers their future earning power.

Instruction is by no means confined, however, to such formal situations. Much of the teaching of magic and skills is limited to occasions when the teacher is called upon to apply his knowledge. When Kekin of Romonum, for example, was asked to build a canoe, he took this occasion to encourage his son, Renipu, to come out with him and get started on the long road to becoming a master builder, a sineenap (main knower). Renipu was but seventeen years old, and his interest was slight. As he grows older he will accompany his father more and more in such activities and slowly acquire the knowledge. Since the number of canoes a man builds is limited—there are no full-time specialists on Truk—it takes several years for him to transmit his knowledge, all of which must be committed to memory, to his sons or junior lineage mates. For this reason the more complicated specialized forms of knowledge are concentrated in the hands of older people. Romonum Island, with a population of 240 souls, for example, has but three recognized master canoe builders. All three have only a few active years ahead of them, and each now has adult children. There is also one man about 40 years of age who is a skillful adzeman and has made a couple of small canoes on his own. He is not considered the equal of the other three, however, and drops in on them when they are at work to see what additional pointers he can pick up. The younger people are just starting seriously to try their hands at such work. Several middle-aged men were attempting their first canoes when our field work was being conducted. These attempts were modest, and the builders were usually so related to the master builders [Page 55] that they could call upon them for advice and help, and even to perform for them some of the more critical operations such as laying out the right measurements. ...
Most important, however, is the fact that a person must learn from his father or an older lineage mate. Until the death of an established craftsman, his pupil is not likely to be called upon to exercise his skills and knowledge for others or to have the chance to reap the attendant rewards. Only as some of the older experts die off do those a little younger begin to get recognized as experts themselves, since they serve much the same clientele of kinsmen and neighbors as their predecessors did. In line with this is the expert’s tendency to transmit his knowledge piecemeal, withholding some portion of it until he is too old to exercise his skill.

All religious practitioners as well as craftsmen and magicians are owners of the knowledge necessary to exercise their specialties. The Trukese make no distinction between them and other skilled personnel. There is one important exception to this rule, the spirit medium ( wäättwa or wään ëny). His (or her) position is not based on knowledge so much as on having been possessed by a spirit. This spirit is in no way classed as the medium’s property, nor can it be inherited automatically by a son or lineage mate. The position of a spirit medium, therefore, is different from that of a property holder, except as he uses his abilities to diagnose illness.

He [AL note: another author] called attention, moreover, to the significant fact that the people of Kosrae had no knowledge of how to build or sail voyaging canoes nor any knowledge of navigation (1893:478). Such knowledge, we should add, was also limited on Ponape. In Truk it was known only to a very few of chiefly rank, and they were dependent for it on specialists from the surrounding atolls, from which they also imported their sailing canoes (Kubary 1889:62; Girschner 1912:181). In Yap, sailing canoes were of the type used by the Trukic speaking atoll dwellers to the east, and Yapese terminology relating to navigation is clearly a borrowing from a Trukic source.

Tattooing was done by male specialists and was performed on both sexes. Native methods of tattooing ceased on Truk at about the beginning of the Japanese administration of the islands. Arms, hands, and thighs were the areas most often treated. Informants stated that the tattoo functioned only as an erotic stimulus; they could give no instances of special territorial, kinship, or status markings. The erotic factor was elaborated by one male informant who stated that the tattoo marks visible on the thighs and buttocks of a woman when she removed her wrap-around skirt excited him greatly. He commented on the fact that the women of Mortlock tattooed these areas to a greater extent than did the women of Truk. The age at which tattooing was done varied from about fifteen to thirty.

The next day I learned that Q had gone home and flung himself headfirst off the roof of his house, landing on his chest on a large basalt boulder. A specialist in traditional massage medicine was called in to [Page 80] treat his broken bones and hard and distended abdomen caused by internal injuries. While his family sat around crying over him, the massage specialist worked on him daily for nearly a week without any improvement. One week after his jump, Q was admitted to the hospital in critical condition. He had neither spoken nor eaten during this period. When I left Truk two and a half months later Q remained in the hospital in guarded condition.

When the pains begin the woman in labor bathes in the house. Her mother, mother-in-law, or grandmother acts as midwife and gives her a medicine to facilitate delivery. The recipe for this medicine is an inherited or purchased secret, carefully guarded by the owner. The best midwife on Kambara makes it of beaten hibiscus bark placed in a coconut reticulum bag and steeped in water. A skilled midwife determines [Page 31] by touch whether the unborn child is correctly placed. If not she manipulates it by massage into the proper position at the beginning of labor. ...
The midwife catches the infant as he emerges. If he is short of breath she blows water from her mouth into his face, or she gives a cup of water to the mother and massages the umbilical cord gently with thumb and index finger. If the mother is faint the midwife gives her “medicine to restore her breath”, made according to her private recipe. When the child is breathing regularly the umbilical cord is cut by the mother's mother or the midwife. This was formerly done with a shell or a bamboo knife. The method, introduced by the government, of cutting the cord with a pair of scissors and tying it with a piece of string, is used occasionally. An old Fulanga woman thinks that the modern method of tying the cord is injurious because the bad blood cannot flow away. As [Page 32] soon as the child is born the mother is given a second drink of medicine to bring forth the afterbirth. If it does not appear the mother's abdomen is pressed and the cord is pulled.

In fishing, especially deep-sea fishing, and in some other crafts, knowledge of the technical processes and of the associated [Page 103] ritual is unequally distributed. As could be expected, it is linked with special mannal aptitude in them. Here are terms not for industrious persons as such, but for skilled, knowledgeable persons, such as tufu[unknown]a (expert craftsman), tautai (sea-expert), and ta[unknown]ata o atu (man of bonito) (see later). One effect of the possession of such knowledge lacking in others is the opportunity of enlarging one's resources. This is done by resort to fishing banks not commonly known, or use of a special technique at times when the fish refuse all others; or, in the case of a craftsman, by more prompt replacement of his implements, or by gaining goods in payment for his work for others; or to a small extent by the securing of a material return for the imparting of his knowledge to others. Important as an inducement to the acquisition of such personal knowledge, however, is the prestige that it obtains.

What has been said above [that chiefs and leaders tend to be more knowledgeable than laypersons] refers primarily to the knowledge of ritual procedure, names of the gods and the like. To some extent the distribution of purely technical knowledge follows the same pattern, though here there is more tendency for younger men to acquire a fund of information which they can put to immediate practical use. But on the whole I found, naturally enough, that elderly men had a much greater range of knowledge and were much more conversant with precise details than the younger men. Moreover, there is no rigid separation between technical and ritual knowledge, and the recognition of certain men, either chiefs or commoners, as experts means that they are not only skilled above the average in the actual performance of a craft, and know more about its technical details, but that they have a greater body of knowledge about the ritual which pertains to it.

In the emergence of a specialist craftsman individual training plays some part, as when a father makes for his son a model of a house lashing in order to demonstrate the peculiar technique involved, or has the lad at his side when he is engaged in woodwork, or in fishing. But here the personal factors of individual interest and aptitude are paramount and there is no attempt to force the child into following his father's special craft. Since every specialist also takes part in the general productive activity in other fields there is plenty of scope for any member of a family who shows no particular bent for a specialized craft. Some children appear to develop as specialists at quite an early age. Seuku, a boy of about twelve, was a wood-worker to whom other boys went to get heads for their darts. These were quite passable specimens, as was also a model of a club which he made for his own interest and which I bought from him. Again, when some children imitated a current activity of their elders and began to remodel the bow of a small canoe, it was Seuku who acted as tufu[unknown]a and directed the work. Seuku appeared to have developed [Page 115] largely on his own initiative; neither his father nor his elder brothers had any special proficiency as wood-workers. On the other hand there is sometimes a continuity in the practice of a craft by members of a family, as in tattooing. 1 
For some details see Man . 1936, 236.
The house of Niukapu has an ancient tradition of seamanship; and the chiefly house of Taumako a reputation for skill in all the major crafts. A man of Tafua, who could be expected to belittle rather than praise their accomplishments, said to me, “They are the tufu[unknown]a house in this land; they are expert indeed in all things.”

But for such taboos to be respected at all, there had to be some information, even minimally, about them. In 1952 many of the older Christians had still such information, and though they might regard it as outmoded as a basis for active belief, they still tended to treat it as a status property. One man, for instance, was proud of his former skill as a chanter of the ceremonial public formula of thanks shouted in acknowledgement of a feast given by a chief. In the traditional Tikopia schemes such feasts were not only marks of the advancing age and status of the chief but were also occasions for his public worship of his gods and ancestors. (I heard such a recital in May 1952 at a feast of the Ariki Taumako.) The reciter of this formula ( oriori ) had to be a man of fluent tongue, good articulation and lung power, clear memory and high status. The recital of the oriori was in a sense a mark of allegiance to the pagan system. Yet this Christian vaunted his prowess. ‘The man who recites the oriori must be an expert; the man who is not clever will go wrong!’ 1 Many other Tikopia who had participated in pagan rites but were now Christian regarded their knowledge as giving them status.

The “magic” of protection is much more limited in its practitioners. On the one hand, there are those who have a specific status entitlement -- ritual elders of lineages ( matapure ) and especially chiefs of clans ( ariki ) -- to care for the welfare of their group members. But while Tikopia is rigid in its adherence to the principle of patrilineal descent, it does not confine spiritual benefits so closely, and custom allows help to be obtained by resort to another than one's own lineage or clan head. (This custom has an advantage in that it is part of the mechanism of organization in practice and theory to deal with failure.) 
On the other hand, “magic” of protection can also be performed by persons of another social category, the spirit mediums ( vaka atua ). For practice in this capacity no particular status is required, only the ability to enter a state of dissociation and give the appropriate social responses. Here is an opportunity for women. No woman can be a chief or a ritual elder, 6 but it is not uncommon for women, of ordinary as well as chiefly families, to be spirit mediums. Nor is this thought abnormal, or disapproved of, and they attend male as well as female patients. The “magical” procedures of protection and healing are more highly specialized and individualized than those of production. Much of them is common knowledge in the society at large, but the practitioners are regarded as having the special entitlement by status or capacity which secures them from imitation. No-one would use a procedure he had just [Page 102] “picked up”, as he might with some “magic” of production. There is a higher degree of esoteric conten', a greater degree of systematization, a more complete “performance”.

The training of a boy, however, is often due to the interest of one of his mother's brothers in him. If this man is an expert in any branch of knowledge he will probably see to it that his nephew receives some of the results of his experience. If he is a noted canoe-voyager and fisherman he will pass on his store of information in the finer points of his craft to the lad: especially will he show him the location of fishing-banks, a prized set of date not possessed by all fishermen. In dirges composed to the memory of mothers' brothers refereuce is not infrequently made to this sort of assistance. A grandfather may take a great interest in a child's upbringing and may provide him with traditional lore, names of family ancestor and their history, tales of ancient fights and immigrations of the origins of the land and the doings of the gods. The transmitation of details of family ritual and more esoteric information concerning the family religious life is essentially the role of the father, and not infrequently does the head of a house lament the fact of his own comparative ignorance due to his father's early death. Individual circumstances vary considerably in this respect, but as a rule in such cases the gap is filled more or less adequately by a father's brother or even a father's sister, who will be acquainted in some degree with the requisite information.

In the course of time certain paito have come to possess an individuality, to be credited with a set of traits peculiar to their members, which has been acquired through generations of achievement or [Page 352] habit. Thus the house of Taumako are recognized as toa , men of strong personality, and virile, ready to fight and to command. In the traditional account of Tikopia history this reputation has been fairly consistently upheld throughout the centuries. Present members of this house are recognized as keepers of the peace in the island, and exercise considerable authority of a personal kind for which no allowance is made in the social structure. They are also a house of craftsmen, particularly as workers in wood. The house of Niukapu are renowned particularly as tautai , sea-experts. Various ancestors of theirs in the past have been noted sea-voyagers and navigators, a reputation which the folk of Taumako also share to some degree. The house of Tafua, which has had noted voyagers in its time, is known at the present time principally for its prowess in fishing, and also in the dance.

Young women in song sometimes assert their intention of scorning marriage, but there is in Tikopia no other career which offers any real social advantages. The type of spirit mediumship which [a woman] obtains does not sufficiently differentiate its practitioners from the general body of people to provide women with any great inducement to pursue it as their sole vocation.

The pursuit of First-Time knowledge is a strictly solitary endeavor, and in any clan the number of older men considered really to “know things” can be counted on a single hand. (Women and youths, with few exceptions, are prohibited a priori from entering deeply into the world of First-Time knowledge.) Within any clan, each expert’s knowledge is idiosyncratic, learned from a unique network of older kinsmen and reflecting that individual’s particular strengths as a historian. Over the course of his adult lifetime, each interested man must construct his own images and analyses of “what really happened” two and three centuries ago, based on bits and pieces of relevant songs and rites, disputes, and celebrations that he makes it his business to attend to, as well as on the supplementary narratives he is able to wheedle out of his often-reluctant older kinsmen. The Saramaka historian-in-training hoes a very long row; those that take it on as a vocation, like the very finest of our own historians, seem positively driven by an inner need to make sense of the past, quite apart from the prestige that may incidentally accrue from their special mastery.
It may be useful to contrast the solitary nature of the Saramaka historian’s vocation with the collective efforts of elders in certain other societies to preserve secret and dangerous knowledge. In Pueblo society, for example, it is small groups that strive to maintain a monopoly on such knowledge: “Religious knowledge is necessary for political power within the community. If this knowledge can be restricted to a very small group, that group can control the community” (Brandt 1980: 131). In Saramaka, however, where the idea of a “body” of First-Time knowledge or the idea of a “group” of initiates is largely absent, individuals tend to operate independently in the acquisition, dissemination, and use of such knowledge, even when it is offered up or called upon in the service of a social group. Because of the noncollective nature of the learning and use of First-Time knowledge, disagreements and confrontations are largely avoided; it is accepted that different Saramaka historians will have different versions, and it is up to the listener to piece together for himself the version of an event that he, for the time being, accepts.
Several of the most knowledgeable Saramaka historians explicitly credit their accumulation of special knowledge to their own natural curiosity and “shameless” insistence in pressing their elders.

For historically-knowledgeable Saramakas, Kwasímukámba represents the prototypical symbol of betrayal, a constant reminder of the necessity to be guarded in all relations with outsiders. As we have seen in the first section of this book, everyday Saramaka proverbs and folktales are filled with morals about not trusting other people, and the story of nóuna, outlined there, was considered emblematic of such concerns. But the idea—expressed so often in daily life—that knowledge is power, and that one should not reveal all of what one knows, becomes magnified enormously for Saramakas whenever dealing with First-Time, with ritual, or with [Page 154] outsiders. And the highly secret story of Kwasímukámba combines all three of these contexts of heightened danger. This is why it has come to epitomize for Saramakas all of the fearsome risks of sharing confidences with outsiders.

Although certain women are known for their ability to assist with pregnancies and births, they undergo no formal training. Rather, women with other kinds of ritual expertise slowly accumulate experience as midwives by being consulted on particular problems, and shift very gradually into the role of a “woman who delivers with people,” usually when they are postmenopausal.

About twenty years ago, José of Anüyuhtí longhouse went to hunt white-lipped peccaries. He shot one, which was especially fierce because its mate was about to give birth. The peccary gored José in the knee, but he killed it with his dogs. He limped back to the longhouse, carrying the dead peccary. The wound got very bad. Old Arturo, the most knowledgeable of Bará shamans, started a curing chant, but José was ready to die. His feet were already cold and only his heart moved. Old Arturo went to Ewüra wi, a longhouse near Ewüra taró. He saw José already there, standing outside the door. He was putting on black body paint, festive ornaments, and feathers. His mother and his father were there, and many people awaited him. José had almost finished painting himself and was about to enter the longhouse. If he had entered, he would have died in this world. The people at Anüyuhtí were already crying. Old Arturo came and pushed José away from the doorway. Many peccaries were outside the house waiting, and Old Arturo began to scare them with his power. First he summoned a big wind. The peccaries said that wind had been around since the beginning of the world. Then Old Arturo summoned a tremendous fire, which did scare them. They lined up and began to enter the longhouse. He made them shut all the doors, which he closed with big logs. Old Arturo took away [Page 50] their aüawüri (long flutes), taking away their dances, taking away their hearts. When Old Arturo returned to this world, he carried these flutes in his throat, and José recovered. But this is why there are no peccaries in these parts today.

Compi children gain knowledge not only in school and by the informal education of their parents in domestic skills, they also acquire specialized skills and knowledge of herbal cures, magical and religious rites, omens, the network of kinship and the local political structure and the traditional measurements of time, space, and weight, The extent of their knowledge of the foregoing depends on whether a member of the family is a specialist; the children of curers are better acquainted with herbal remedies than the other children in the community.

Not only do they [the Aymara] have an extraordinary number of categories of doctors and practitioners, and a variety of medical and magical procedures, a striking native knowledge and nomenclature of anatomy, and an enormous list of materia medica--thus far a development of purely “professional” skills--but they also, as laymen, have a considerable participation in this specialized knowledge, and are constantly “doctoring” themselves with common remedies for their almost daily ills. ...
Aymara medicine is highly specialízed, and consequently has a great many different categories of practitioners. The following all practice medicine in one form or another: the q'olawayu (from q'ofa , medicine, and wayu , a kind of bolsa); the amau[unknown]a (a learned man, the same as ha[unknown]ca amtañani , “[one] with big thoughts,” ha[unknown]camunani ,“[one] with much affection,” i.e.,practitioner of good magic, and ha[unknown]ca[unknown]eq'enu , “[one] with a big head”); the various witches like the laiq'a , or the tala ( tata ); the diagnosticians or diviners like the mifu[unknown]ciri the q'oa[unknown]ciri , and the kukatuñiri ; the [unknown]camakani (lit., “with darkness”) and the [unknown]camakiri (“he who darkens”) who call at night upon their familiar spirits--owls, snakes, frogs, and birds--in hunting out and counteracting witchcraft; the loq'tiri (from loq'ta , sacrifice) who makes offerings to the spirits; the yatiri, q'amiri, t'aliri, ham[unknown]iri, q'amili ; the sir[unknown]oq'amani and q'ofaq'amani (“he who has cures,” and “he who has medicines,” respectively); and the various other specialists who practice the methods of curing by t'alantaña, [unknown]c'uimaq'aq'oña (a kind of chiropractic), truq'aq'a, lum[unknown]aq'a , and pi[unknown]c'aq'a . It is probably safe to say that no other primitive group known to modern ethnology has such a rich specialization among practitioners of native medicine. ...
This behavior of the Collawayu makes clear several facts which are true of all Aymara medicine in general. Since disease is caused by the evil machinations of witches and spirits, the medicine-man must both divine the cause, overcome it with more powerful witchcraft, and cure the ill medically or magically as the case may be. The difference between the various practitioners, therefore, is not only in the means of divination which they employ but also in the character of their magic, and in the mode of curing. However, the witches such as the laiq'a or the tala pass over easily into the counter-witches like the [unknown]camakani and the [unknown]camakiri , both of whom work in the dark of night.

The sirkaq'amani is the Aymara surgeon, who treats fractures, luxations, and wounds. Very probably it was this practitioner who in ancient times 312 [Page 224] performed the trephinings for which this region is famous among physical anthorpologists and archaeologists. Skulls have been found with as many as five successful trepanations--which argues for a certain skill in the surgeon, as well as for the vitality of the patient. Krogman 313 considers that the purpose of trephining was to relieve compression fractures of the skull caused by warclubs, but Ronhaar believes that trephining was performed most often for epilepsy or migraine (if the epilepsy were traumatic, it comes to the same thing). Trepanation was done by sawing, cutting, scraping, and drilling with chips of flint, obsidian, quartz, and possibly blades of copper. A gourd, shell, or plaque of silver controlled the herniation of the brain through the operation. Similar is the bleeding performed upon the root of the nose, although this may have been to relieve the swelling in this area caused by a disease called “Gundu.” Another surgical procedure was to tie off multiple lipomata with horse-hairs until they sloughed off.

Important as are the many kinds of practitioners mentioned in the preceding section, the most important of all are the various kinds of q'oliri (chief among whom is the q'olawayu ) who use plant, animal, and mineral substances as actual medicines. These medicines are used both externally and internally, as poultices and as ptisans or infusions. By far the greater number of Aymara medicines are of plant origin, the detailed discussion and identification of which is to be published elsewhere. Many of these (e.g., airampu, Opuntia soehrensii Britton and Rose), a cactus used in treating angina, seem pharmacologically very plausible as medicines, for related species are already part of official European pharmacopoeias. Others, such as quinine, are still the best drugs known to modern science for specific purposes. One might well urge the attention of chemists, pharmacologists, and doctors to such native medicines, for laboratory research might on occasion establish their scientific value.

Much love magic is practiced, either by the interested party or, at his or her instigation, by a practitioner of white ( paqo ) or black magic ( laiqa ). Charms and spells are used to attract a lover, to repel an unwanted spouse or lover, or to break up a happy union (Paredec, 1936, pp. 76-77, 121-22). Diviners are frequently consulted to find out what type of spouse should be sought or to discover the infidelity of a husband or wife.

Powers to cure disease are shared by several classes of doctors, who are distinguished by the types of disease in which they specialize, their techniques of diagnosis, and their methods of curing. In addition to specialists in magical cures (see Practitioners of Magic, p. 564), three classes of medical practitioners (the qolawayu , the t'aliri , and the qolasiri ) cure by essentially practical means, although employing some magic. These doctors appear to require no supernatural experience in order to practice their professions.
The medical terminology is complex. The generic word for medicine is qola and for doctor, qolasiri , literally, “he who knows medicine”; other names for doctors refer specifically to the techniques they employ. Although either sex may practice medicine, most doctors are men. Doctors who continually fail in their cures are often driven from the community and occasionally are killed by the angry relatives of a deceased patient.

The qolasiri are bone-setters, herbalists, and general practitioners who tend strongly to specialize. Some are known for their abilities to diagnose disease, some for their success in internal medicine, and others for their skill as bone-setters. The qolasiri ordinarily divines with coca, but uses a guinea pig for more important cases. He places the live guinea pig in contact with the patient's body for a short time, [Page 570] after which the patient breathes on it three times. The guinea pig is then cut open and examined; any defective organs indicate which of the patient's organs are diseased. In a similar diagnosis, an unidentified mineral called qolpa is placed in contact with the patient's body, burned, and the cause of disease divined from its remains. A third technique involves a mineral ( mi[unknown]u, largely alum) which is placed in the patient's urine (La Barre, ms.).

In Chucuito, there are two qolabiri , both of whom are middleaged men. One of these individuals learned to cure from his father, while the other learned from his paternal uncle.
After the diagnosis, the doctor may cure with various medicines. The disease, if due to evil spirits, may be transferred magically to the object used in the diagnosis, which is then either destroyed or returned to the source of the evil, or the disease may be magically sent away. The patient is made to lie down on a blanket which is covered with food, clothing, and valuables, after which he is washed and the water and the other objects deposited near a river; whoever carries away these also carries away the disease. Formerly, in the event of an epidemic, a black llama was loaded with the clothing of the infected person and driven out of the village to carry away the disease (Forbes, 1870, p. 45).

Hostility towards relatives and other Aymara of the community is expressed principally through sorcery and lawsuits. Through the medium of the sorcerer and his black magic the individual is able to punish his enemy in a socially recognized, if socially disapproved, manner (see p. 283). This specialist, the laiqa , is a disinterested professional practitioner whose services are available to all and to whom no blame is usually attached. Such an indirect and oblique attack to a degree satisfies the cultural prohibition against open hostility; at the same time, this sly, underhanded, and secret act enables the person to express his hostile impulses without letting others know its source or who is involved. 3 Lawsuits likewise satisfy the cultural requirements in that they are conducted objectively and through a disinterested professional intermediary. As in sorcery, the aggrieved person is able to vent his hostility and to see his enemy humiliated or punished even though, as not infrequently happens, he himself becomes bankrupted in the process.
The non-aggressive ways of handling hostility, [Page [p. 181 b]] touched upon in the foregoing pages, can be summarized briefly as follows: Gossip and ridicule represent responses that are widely employed, and the malice so expressed tends to be biting, direct, and sustained. Owing to the progressive breakdown of cooperative enterprises, however, the opportunities for effective public ridicule are becoming increasingly infrequent. While gossip is effective in the more closely knit society of Chucuito village, it is far less potent among the scattered Aymara of the ayllus.

Much has been written about the qolawayu , the most famous of Aymara doctors. (See Paredes, 1936, pp. 185-95; Bandelier, 1910, pp. 103, 155; La Barre, ms.) These traveling herbalists and vendors of amulets live chiefly in the Provinces of Caupolicán and Muñecas in Bolivia and constitute a special cultural subgroup of the Aymara . They possess distinctive dress and customs, and are said by some to speak a special dialect of the Aymara language. All men of this subtribe are trained as herbalists. They travel widely over South America, often being away from their villages for several years.

Doctors also administer emetics and cathartics but use no enemas. Herbs are given to speed difficult births and to shorten menstrual periods. Sprains and dislocations are massaged with chewed coca. While bloodletting is occasionally practiced, it is probably of Spanish introduction (Bandelier, ms.).
Surgery today is simple; amputation is not practiced, nor teeth extracted. Broken bones are set in many thin splints. Formerly, the Aymara successfully trepanned crania in order to relieve depressed skull fractures, although this practice appears to be obsolete today. If the patient is in pain, he is made to drink himself into a state of insensibility and to chew a quantity of coca for its anesthetic effect.

In one form or another, coca is part of the ritual paraphernalia of every Aymara practitioner. Divination with coca leaves is the stock-in-trade of the yatiri , while the qolasiri uses coca in diagnosis, as a medicine, and, occasionally, as an anaesthetic. The midwife compounds is into childbirth remedies, and the t'aliri employs it for massages. Sorcerers offer coca to demons and to evil places; in the practice of benevolent magic it is an integral and necessary part of all offerings: to spirits, cairns, and shrines, to perfect vegetables and fish, to amulets and sacred objects, and occasionally to disease itself. In addition, during All Souls fiesta, coca is offered to the dead.

Rural Bahian families were indeed self-sufficient in their healing, but their isolation forced it on them. On plantations, the master was often obliged to attempt healing. In the 1860’s, the head of the Pinheiro Canguçu family treated virtually every ailment of family members and moradores on his plantation, consulting a medical handbook and traditional family recipes, leaving only amputations to the doctor from Caetité. With the habit of self-reliance came skepticism of the special knowledge of doctors. Anna Ribeiro’s family did not get her eyes treated in the 1850’s because they did not trust doctors. One treatment to decrease her eye inflammation had left the scars of abscesses on her upper arms.
As doctors asserted authority over parents, they confronted, not the patriarch, but rather other figures who could claim expertise. The medical literature on childbearing and childrearing abounds in attacks on wet nurses, midwives, and old wives who might presume to speak with authority or to interpret tradition. Theses and treatises on childbirth typically mention with contempt the baths in wine given to newborns by superstitious midwives. Wet nurses, besides being “mercenary,” were to be condemned because they were “[in our country] ordinarily Africans, stupid, immoral, without education,” and they were stigmatized as bearers of syphilis. But the generalized attack on customs, on usos, commonly identified no specific culprit. It implied that women’s lore was superstition. Significantly, a guide addressed to a general public, rather than a thesis directed principally to other doctors, made this most explicit, saying that pregnancy is usually simple if the woman follows good sense and hygiene, not popular tales and the advice of “matrons.”

On midwives, see Cerqueira, Prophylaxia alimentar (1903), p. 18. Although one twentieth-century doctor, Almeida Gouvéia, was able to assemble strong evidence of the perniciousness of the old ways, in most cases in the nineteenth century, the attack did not rest on such clear empirical evidence. Almeida Gouvéia’s well—documented thesis traced infant tetanus mortality to home births on certain streets, and ultimately to the unlicensed midwives ( aparadeiras) living on those streets, who probably applied the traditional plasters of spiderweb powder, dung, and tobacco dust to the umbilicus (Gouvéia, Puericultura social, p. 207).

One of Bahia’s most exclusive clubs, membership in which is definitely indicative of advanced social status, is composed of Bahian “society,” including most of the leading officials and many of the more prominent citizens. Numerous receptions for visiting celebrities are held at this club, and its dances are considered to be among the principal social functions of the year. No blacks have yet been admitted, although several mixed-bloods, including a number of brancos da Bahia and even a few dark mulattoes, are regular and honored members. Whites, of course, predominate.
Among the members is a dark mixed-blood, with Caucasian hair and features, a prominent citizen, an able eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist trained in Europe, and husband of a white wife. Of him a Bahian of undiluted European descent once commented, “You know when I went to see him about my eyes the other day, I never once thought of him as colored. I needed professional advice and I simply recalled that he, like his father before him, was the best eye specialist in Bahia.” Another member of this club is a dark mixed-blood, a wealthy exporter, prominent in Bahian commercial circles, and husband of a white wife, upon whose visits into the interior, it is said, all those with whom he has business dealings (including whites) feel deeply honored when he visits them in their homes.

[After some discussion about incest taboos, how they apply to intra-moiety relations, and how they are apparently sometimes broken.] Besides, to the Bororo the examples from the mythical past are the rules for today's life, and a knowledgeable man will always find enough examples to justify his behavior. If he is Kiye or Bokodori Echerae, there will be no difficulty in finding precedents for intra-moiety relations. ... The ensuing rule is quite clear: you can have sexual relations with whomever pleases you, but, as a civilized man with respect for tradition and a little fear of your yorubodare , you should marry a woman from the opposite moiety.

The Jesuits, nevertheless, attempted to save Indian lives by having them build separate hospitals for men and women and another hospital for those women who were pregnant and about to give birth to a child. Instead of hospital beds, the sick Indians slept in cotton hammocks. Ideally, the natives constructed these hospitals outside the mission towns, but some hospitals were built near the main plazas in the center of town, such as those at Apostoles and San Nicolás. The Jesuits also instructed the Indians to build many temporary, individual shelters called teyupas for those Indians they suspected might have a headache or displayed other early warning signs of a virus. This way those Guaraní who were coming down with an illness were kept in isolation from their families and other members of the community. In each mission, there were at least four to eight native medical practitioners, nurses and curanderos (medicine men) who relied upon their traditional herbal remedies to cure the sick. If their natural herbs proved to be ineffective, then the practitioners would consult with the missionaries who served as physicians on the missions and had access to medical books in the mission library. 110 In this respect, the Jesuits highly valued and adopted the natives’ use of herbal medicine to heal the Indians to a certain extent. During epidemics, the missionaries asked those Indians who were healthy enough to have recovered from an illness or disease to care for those Indians who were sick. Evidently, the Jesuits knew that these natives had built up immunities which would prevent them from falling ill again. These voluntary nurses usually fed the [Page 222] sick a special diet of squash ( andai ), barley, and other vegetables, instead of the usual meat, manioc, and mbeyú (manioc pancakes). The Jesuits accepted the use of a native herbal remedy called aguaraibay which the Indians used to bathe themselves and which would help heal sores on their bodies caused by a disease. When the Indians burned this native plant inside the hospital, the missionaries believed that the smoke would help stop the spread of disease by purifying the buildings. On the other hand, in the minds of the Indians, the smoke may have driven away any evil spirits which caused their illnesses. The clothes of those Indians who recuperated were also burned, and he or she was given a new set of clothes before returning to the town. 111 All of these protective measures most likely helped to prevent the spread of disease in the missions. Since the Jesuits practiced the concept of isolation and the burning of the clothes of those Guaraní who were stricken with disease, the natives probably benefited from the Jesuits’ knowledge of medical treatment, which appears to have been more advanced than in Spanish American colonial towns in this period.

Medicine made up a small portion of household expenditures. Indigenous medicines are effective against most ailments such as parasitosis or headaches, but Chiripá use commercial medicines against more persistent problems. The local mestizo medical specialist is a poorly trained pharmacist who sells a variety of Brazilian medicines from his home. Pain relievers and antibiotics are dispensed in packets of one or two, making them accessible (if not effective) to the consumer with even a small amount of cash. Major medical problems, such as tuberculosis or leishmaniasis, are treated by roving doctors supported by international agencies.
